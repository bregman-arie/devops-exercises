## DevOps

<details>
<summary>What is DevOps?</summary><br><b>

Amazon:

"DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market."

Microsoft:

"DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users. The contraction of “Dev” and “Ops” refers to replacing siloed Development and Operations to create multidisciplinary teams that now work together with shared and efficient practices and tools. Essential DevOps practices include agile planning, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring of applications."

Red Hat:

"DevOps describes approaches to speeding up the processes by which an idea (like a new software feature, a request for enhancement, or a bug fix) goes from development to deployment in a production environment where it can provide value to the user. These approaches require that development teams and operations teams communicate frequently and approach their work with empathy for their teammates. Scalability and flexible provisioning are also necessary. With DevOps, those that need power the most, get it—through self service and automation. Developers, usually coding in a standard development environment, work closely with IT operations to speed software builds, tests, and releases—without sacrificing reliability."

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the benefits of DevOps? What it can help us to achieve?</summary><br><b>

  * Collaboration
  * Improved delivery
  * Security
  * Speed
  * Scale
  * Reliability
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the anti-patterns of DevOps?</summary><br><b>

* Not allowing to push in production on Friday :)
* One specific person is in charge of different tasks. For example there is only one person who is allowed to merge the code of everyone else
* Treating production differently from development environment. For example, not implementing security in development environment
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Continuous Integration?</summary><br><b>

A development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently. It can range from a couple of changes every day or a week to a couple of changes in one hour in larger scales.

Each piece of code (change/patch) is verified, to make the change is safe to merge. Today, it's a common practice to test the change using an automated build that makes sure the code can integrated. It can be one build which runs several tests in different levels (unit, functional, etc.) or several separate builds that all or some has to pass in order for the change to be merged into the repository.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Continuous Deployment?</summary><br><b>

A development strategy used by developers to release software automatically into production where any code commit must pass through an automated testing phase. Only when this is successful is the release considered production worthy. This eliminates any human interaction and should be implemented only after production-ready pipelines have been set with real-time monitoring and reporting of deployed assets. If any issues are detected in production it should be easy to rollback to previous working state.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Continuous Delivery?</summary><br><b>

A development strategy used to frequently deliver code to QA and Ops for testing. This entails having a staging area that has production like features where changes can only be accepted for production after a manual review. Because of this human entanglement there is usually a time lag between release and review making it slower and error prone as compared to continous deployment.

For more info please read [here](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-deployment)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What CI/CD best practices are you familiar with? Or what do you consider as CI/CD best practice?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Where do you store CI/CD pipeline? (Application repository, one central repository, ...)? Why?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What systems and/or tools are you using for the following areas/tasks? Why?

  * CI/CD
  * Provisioning infrastructure
  * Configuration Management
  * Monitoring & alerting
  * Logging
  * Code review
  * Code coverage
  * Tests</summary><br><b>
  * CI/CD - Jenkins, Circle CI, Travis
  * Provisioning infrastructure - Terraform, CloudFormation
  * Configuration Management - Ansible, Puppet, Chef
  * Monitoring & alerting - Prometheus, Nagios
  * Logging - Logstash, Graylog, Fluentd
  * Code review - Gerrit, Review Board
  * Code coverage - Cobertura, Clover, JaCoCo
  * Tests - Robot, Serenity, Gauge
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are you taking into consideration when choosing a tool/technology?</summary><br><b>

In your answer you can mention one or more of the following:
  * mature vs. cutting edge
  * community size
  * architecture aspects - agent vs. agentless, master vs. masterless, etc.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain mutable vs. immutable infrastructure</summary><br><b>

In mutable infrastructure paradigm, changes are applied on top of the existing infrastructure and over time
the infrastructure builds up a history of changes. Ansible, Puppet and Chef are examples of tools which
follow mutable infrastructure paradigm.

In immutable infrastructure paradigm, every change is actually a new infrastructure. So a change
to a server will result in a new server instead of updating it. Terraform is an example of technology
which follows the immutable infrastructure paradigm.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What ways are you familiar with to deliver a software? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method?</summary><br><b>

  * Source - Maintain build script within version control system so that user can build your app after cloning repository. Advantage: User can quickly checkout different versions of application. Disadvantage: requires build tools installed on users machine.
  * Archive - collect all your app files into one archive (e.g. tar) and deliver it to the user. Advantage: Only tool needed is an unarchiver. Disadvantage: Requires repeating the same procedure when updating, not good if there are a lot of dependencies.
  * Package - depends on the OS, you can use your OS package format (e.g. in RHEL/Fefodra it's RPM) to deliver your software with a way to install, uninstall and update it using the standard packager commands. Advantages: Package manager takes care of support for installation, uninstallation, updating and dependency management. Disadvantage: Requires managing package repository.
  * Images - Either VM or container images where your package is included with everything it needs in order to run successfully. Advantage: everything is preinstalled, it has high degree of environment isolation. Disadvantage: Requires knowledge of building and optimizing images.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is caching? How does it works? Why is it important?</summary><br><b>
	Caching is fast access to frequently used resources which are computationally expensive or IO intensive and do not change often. There can be several layers of cache that can start from CPU caches to distributed cache systems. Common ones are in memory caching and distributed caching. <br/> Caches are typically data structures that contains some data, such as a hashtable or dictionary. However, any data structure can provide caching capabilities, like set, sorted set, sorted dictionary etc. While, caching is used in many applications, they can create subtle bugs if not implemented correctly or used correctly. For example,cache invalidation, expiration or updating is usually quite challenging and hard.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain stateless vs. stateful</summary><br><b>

Stateless applications don't store any data in the host which makes it ideal for horizontal scaling and microservices.
Stateful applications depend on the storage to save state and data, typically databases are stateful applications.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Reliability? How does it fit DevOps?</summary><br><b>

Reliability, when used in DevOps context, is the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure failure or disruption. Part of it is also being able to scale based on your organization or team demands.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What "Availability" means? What means are there to track Availability of a service?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the workflow of setting up some type of web server (Apache, IIS, Tomcat, ...)</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How a web server works?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain "Open Source"</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe me the architecture of service/app/project/... you designed and/or implemented</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What types of tests are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

Styling, unit, functional, API, integration, smoke, scenario, ...

You should be able to explain those that you mention.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You need to install periodically a package (unless it's already exists) on different operating systems (Ubuntu, RHEL, ...). How would you do it?</summary><br><b>

There are multiple ways to answer this question (there is no right and wrong here):

* Simple cron job
* Pipeline with configuration management technology (such Puppet, Ansible, Chef, etc.)
...
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the differences between SRE and DevOps?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What SRE team is responsible for?</summary><br><b>

One can argue whether it's per company definition or a global one but at least according to a large companies, like Google for example, the SRE team is responsible for availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning of their services
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an error budget?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are MTTF (mean time to failure) and MTTR (mean time to repair)? What these metrics help us to evaluate?</summary><br><b>

	* MTTF (mean time to failure) other known as uptime, can be defined as how long the system run before if fails.
	* MTTR (mean time to recover) on the other hand, is the amount of time it takes to repair a system.
	* MTBF (mean time between failues) is the amount of time between failures of the system. These errors can be intermittent or fatal.

</b></details>


<details>
<summary>What is "infrastructure as code"? What implementation of IAC are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>
	IAC (infrastructure as code) is a declerative approach of defining infrastructure or architecture of a system. Some implementations are ARM templates for Azure and Terraform that can work across multiple cloud providers.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you manage build artifacts?</summary><br><b>
	Build artifacts are usually stored in a repository. They can be used in release pipelines for deployment purposes. Usually there is retention period on the build artifacts.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What Continuous Integration solution are you using/prefer and why?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What deployment strategies are you familiar with or have used?</summary><br><b>

	There are several deployment strategies:
	* Rolling
	* Blue green deployment
	* Canary releases
	* Recreate strategy

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You joined a team where everyone developing one project and the practice is to run tests locally on their workstation and push it to the repository if the tests passed. What is the problem with the process as it is now and how to improve it?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain test-driven development (TDD)</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain agile software development</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What do you think about the following sentence?: "implementing or practicing DevOps leads to more secure software"</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Do you know what is a "post-mortem meeting"? What is your opinion on that?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you perform plan capacity for your CI/CD resources? (e.g. servers, storage, etc.)</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you structure/implement CD for an application which depends on several other applications?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you measure your CI/CD quality? Are there any metrics or KPIs you are using for measuring the quality?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a configuration drift? What problems is it causing?</summary><br><b>

Configuration drift happens when in an environment of servers with the exact same configuration and software, a certain server
or servers are being applied with updates or configuration which other servers don't get and over time these servers become
slightly different than all others.

This situation might lead to bugs which hard to identify and reproduce.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to deal with a configuration drift?</summary><br><b>
	Configuration drift can be avoided with desired state configuration (DSC) implementation. Desired state configuration can be a declarative file that defined how a system should be. There are tools to enforce desired state such a terraform or azure dsc. There are incramental or complete strategies.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Do you have experience with testing cross-projects changes? (aka cross-dependency)</summary><br><b>

Note: cross-dependency is when you have two or more changes to separate projects and you would like to test them in mutual build instead of testing each change separately.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Have you contributed to an open source project? Tell me about this experience</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Are you familiar with "The Cathedral and the Bazaar models"? Explain each of the models</summary><br><b>

* Cathedral - source code released when software is released
* Bazaar - source code is always available publicly (e.g. Linux Kernel)
</b></details>

## Jenkins

<details>
<summary>What is Jenkins? What have you used it for?</summary><br><b>

Jenkins is an open source automation tool written in Java with plugins built for Continuous Integration purpose. Jenkins is used to build and test your software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build. It also allows you to continuously deliver your software by integrating with a large number of testing and deployment technologies.

Jenkins integrates development life-cycle processes of all kinds, including build, document, test, package, stage, deploy, static analysis and much more.

</b></details>

<details>

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Can you describe some of Jenkins best practices?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe how do you add new nodes (agents) to Jenkins</summary><br><b>

You can describe the UI way to add new nodes but better to explain how to do in a way that scales like a script or using dynamic source for nodes like one of the existing clouds.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to acquire multiple nodes for one specific build?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>There are four teams in your organization. How to prioritize the builds of each team? So the jobs of team x will always run before team y for example</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>If you are managing a dozen of jobs, you can probably use the Jenkins UI. How do you manage the creation and deletion of hundreds of jobs every week/month?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are some of Jenkins limitations?</summary><br><b>

  * Testing cross-dependencies (changes from multiple projects together)
  * Starting builds from any stage (although cloudbees implemented something called checkpoints)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you implement an option of a starting a build from a certain stage and not from the beginning?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

</b></details>

## Cloud

<details>
<summary>What is Cloud Computing? What is a Cloud Provider?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the advantages of cloud computing? Mention at least 3 advantages</summary><br><b>

* Pay as you go (or consumption-based payment) - you are paying only for what you are using. No upfront payments and payment stops when resources are no longer used.
* Scalable - resources are scaled down or up based on demand
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What types of Cloud Computing services are there?</summary><br><b>

IAAS - Infrastructure as a Service
PAAS - Platform as a Service
SAAS - Software as a Service
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain each of the following and give an example:

  * IAAS
  * PAAS
  * SAAS</summary><br><b>
  * IAAS - Users have control over complete Operating System and don't need to worry about the physical resources, which is managed by Cloud Service Provider.
  * PAAS - CLoud Service Provider takes care of Operating System, Middlewares and users only need to focus on our Data and Application.
  * SAAS - A cloud based method to provide software to users, software logics running on cloud, can be run on-premises or managed by Cloud Service Provider.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What types of clouds (or cloud deployments) are there?</summary><br><b>

  * Public
  * Hybrid
  * Private
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain each of the following Cloud Computing Deployments:

  * Public
  * Private
  * Hybrid</summary><br><b>
  * Public - Cloud services sharing computing resources among multiple customers
  * Private - Cloud services having computing resources limited to specific customer or organization, managed by third party or organizations itself
  * Hybrid - Combination of public and private clouds
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the differences between Cloud Providers and On-Premise solution?</summary><br><b>

In cloud providers, someone else owns and manages the hardware, hire the relevant infrastructure teams and pays for real-estate (for both hardware and people). You can focus on your business.

In On-Premise solution, it's quite the opposite. You need to take care of hardware, infrastructure teams and pay for everything which can be quite expensive. On the other hand it's tailored to your needs.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Serverless Computing?</summary><br><b>

The main idea behind serverless computing is that you don't need to manage the creation and configuration of server. All you need to focus on is splitting your app into multiple functions which will be triggered by some actions.

It's important to note that:

* Serverless Computing is still using servers. So saying there are no servers in serverless computing is completely wrong
* Serverless Computing allows you to have a different paying model. You basically pay only when your functions are running and not when the VM or containers are running as in other payment models
</b></details>

## AWS

#### Global Infrastructure

<details>
<summary>Explain the following

  * Availability zone
  * Region
  * Edge location</summary><br><b>
AWS regions are data centers hosted across different geographical locations worldwide, each region is completely independent of one another.<br>

Within each region, there are multiple isolated locations known as Availability Zones. Multiple availability zones ensure high availability in case one of them goes down.<br>

Edge locations are basically content delivery network which caches data and insures lower latency and faster delivery to the users in any location. They are located in major cities in the world.
</b></details>

#### AWS IAM

<details>

## Network


<details>
<summary>What is Ethernet?</summary><br><b>

Ethernet simply refers to the most common type of Local Area Network (LAN) used today. A LAN—in contrast to a WAN (Wide Area Network), which spans a larger geographical area—is a connected network of computers in a small area, like your office, college campus, or even home.

<summary>What is TCP/IP?</summary><br><b>

A set of protocols that define how two or more devices can communicate with each other.
To learn more about TCP/IP, read [here](http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/basic-network-reference)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a MAC address? What is it used for?</summary><br><b>

A MAC address is a unique identification number or code used to identify individual devices on the network.

Packets that are sent on the ethernet are always coming from a MAC address and sent to a MAC address. If a network adapter is receiving a packet, it is comparing the packet’s destination MAC address to the adapter’s own MAC address.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>When is this MAC address used?: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an IP address?</summary><br><b>

An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.


</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain subnet mask and given an example</summary><br><b>

A Subnet mask is a 32-bit number that masks an IP address, and divides the IP address into network address and host address. Subnet Mask is made by setting network bits to all "1"s and setting host bits to all "0"s. Within a given network, two host addresses are reserved for special purpose, and cannot be assigned to hosts. The "0" address is assigned a network address and "255" is assigned to a broadcast address, and they cannot be assigned to hosts.

**For Example**

```
| Address Class | No of Network Bits | No of Host Bits | Subnet mask     | CIDR notation |
| ------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| A             | 8                  | 24              | 255.0.0.0       | /8            |

CSMA/CD stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection.
Its primarily focus it to manage access to shared medium/bus where only one host can transmit at a given point of time.

CSMA/CD algorithm:

1. Before sending a frame, it checks whether another host already transmitting a frame.
2. If no one transmitting, it starts transmitting the frame.
3. If two hosts transmitted at the same time, we have a collision.
4. Both hosts stop sending the frame and they send to everyone a 'jam signal' notifying everyone that a collision occurred

<details>
<summary>How does a router works?</summary><br><b>

A router is a physical or virtual appliance that passes information between two or more packet-switched computer networks. A router inspects a given data packet's destination Internet Protocol address (IP address), calculates the best way for it to reach its destination and then forwards it accordingly.

<details>
<summary>What is NAT?</summary><br><b>

 Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more local IP address is translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to provide Internet access to the local hosts.

<details>
<summary>What is a proxy? How does it works? What do we need it for?</summary><br><b>

A proxy server acts as a gateway between you and the internet. It’s an intermediary server separating end users from the websites they browse.

If you’re using a proxy server, internet traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the address you requested. The request then comes back through that same proxy server (there are exceptions to this rule), and then the proxy server forwards the data received from the website to you.

roxy servers provide varying levels of functionality, security, and privacy depending on your use case, needs, or company policy.


</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is TCP? How does it works? What is the 3 way handshake?</summary><br><b>

TCP 3-way handshake or three-way handshake is a process which is used in a TCP/IP network to make a connection between server and client.

A three-way handshake is primarily used to create a TCP socket connection. It works when:

- A client node sends a SYN data packet over an IP network to a server on the same or an external network. The objective of this packet is to ask/infer if the server is open for new connections.
- The target server must have open ports that can accept and initiate new connections. When the server receives the SYN packet from the client node, it responds and returns a confirmation receipt – the ACK packet or SYN/ACK packet.
- The client node receives the SYN/ACK from the server and responds with an ACK packet.

<summary>What is round-trip delay or round-trip time?</summary><br><b>

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_delay): "the length of time it takes for a signal to be sent plus the length of time it takes for an acknowledgement of that signal to be received"

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between TCP and UDP?</summary><br><b>

TCP establishes a connection between the client and the server to guarantee the order of the packages, on the other hand, UDP does not establish a connection between client and server and doesn't handle package order. This makes UDP more lightweight than TCP and a perfect candidate for services like streaming.

[Penguintutor.com](http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/basic-network-reference) provides a good explanation.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What TCP/IP protocols are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain "default gateway"</summary><br><b>

A default gateway serves as an access point or IP router that a networked computer uses to send information to a computer in another network or the internet.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is ARP? How does it works?</summary><br><b>

ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. When you try to ping an IP address on your local network, say 192.168.1.1, your system has to turn the IP address 192.168.1.1 into a MAC address. This involves using ARP to resolve the address, hence its name.

Systems keep an ARP look-up table where they store information about what IP addresses are associated with what MAC addresses. When trying to send a packet to an IP address, the system will first consult this table to see if it already knows the MAC address. If there is a value cached, ARP is not used.

<details>
<summary>What is TTL?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is DHCP? How does it works?</summary><br><b>

It stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, and allocates IP addresses, subnet masks and gateways to hosts. This is how it works:

* A host upon entering a network, broadcasts a message in search of a DHCP server (DHCP DISCOVER)
* An offer message is sent back by the DHCP server as a packet containing lease time, subnet mask, IP addresses, etc (DHCP OFFER)
* Depending on which offer accepted, the client sends back a reply broadcast letting all DHCP servers know (DHCP REQUEST)
* Server sends an acknowledgment (DHCP ACK)

  * man - reference manuals
  * pwd - print working directory
  * df - provides info regarding file system disk space usage
  * file - to find out what kind of a file it is
  * cat - quickly read a file without opening the file, it only displays the file contents
  * cp - make a copy of files and pasting it to a destination
  * mv - moving files and also renaming them
  * grep - print lines that match patterns. Could be nice to mention -v, -r, -E flags
  * nslookup or dig - query nameservers

  cd or "change directory" helps one to change directory when they want to.

  * cd / -> change to the root directory
  * cd ~ -> change to your home directory
  * cd -> change to your home directory
  * cd .. -> change to the directory above your current i.e parent directory
  * cd . -> change to the directory you currently in
  * cd - -> change to the last visited path
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to rename the name of a file or a directory?</summary><br><b>

mv command.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is stored in each of the following paths?</summary><br><b>

  * /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
  * /etc
  * /home

It shows a detailed list of files in a long format. From the left;

* file permissions, number of links, owner name, owner group, file size, timestamp of last modification and directory/file name
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are hidden files/directories? How to list them?</summary><br><b>
These are files directly not displayed after performing a standard ls direct listing. An example of these files are .bashrc which are used to execute some scripts. Some also store configuration about services on your host like .KUBECONFIG. The command used to list them is,

`ls -a`

<details>
<summary>Explain piping. How do you perform piping?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Running the command <code>df</code> you get "command not found". What could be wrong and how to fix it?</summary><br><b>
</b>
<p><b>
Most likely the default/generated $PATH was somehow modified or overridden thus not containing <code>/bin/</code> where df would normally go.
This issue could also happen if bash_profile or any configuration file of your interpreter was wrongly modified, causing erratics behaviours.
You would solve this by fixing your $PATH variable:

As to fix it there are several options:

1. Manually adding what you need to your $PATH <code>PATH="$PATH":/user/bin:/..etc</code>
2. You have your weird env variables backed up.
3. You would look for your distro default $PATH variable, copy paste using method #1

Note: There are many ways of getting errors like this: if bash_profile or any configuration file of your interpreter was wrongly modified; causing erratics behaviours,
permissions issues, bad compiled software (if you compiled it by yourself)... there is no answer that will be true 100% of the time.
</b>
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you schedule tasks periodically?</summary><br><b>

You can use the commands <code>cron</code> and <code>at</code>.
With cron, tasks are scheduled using the following format:

<code>*/30 * * * * bash myscript.sh</code> Executes the script every 30 minutes.

<minute> <hour> <day of month> <month> <day of week> <command to execute>

The tasks are stored in a cron file, you can write in it using <code>crontab -e</code>

Alternatively if you are using a distro with systemd it's recommended to use systemd timers.

##### Permissions

<details>
<summary>How to change the permissions of a file?</summary><br><b>

Using the `chmod` command.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What does the following permissions mean?:

  * 777
  * 644
  * 750</summary><br><b>

<pre>
777 - You give the owner, group and other: Execute (1), Write (2) and Read (4); 4+2+1 = 7.
644 - Owner has Read (4), Write (2), 4+2 = 6; Group and Other have Read (4).
750 - Owner has x+r+w, Group has Read (4) and Execute (1); 4+1 = 5. Other have no permissions.
</pre>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What this command does? <code>chmod +x some_file</code></summary><br><b>
It adds execute permissions to all sets i.e user, group and others
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is setgid and setuid</summary><br><b>

* setuid is a linux file permission that permits a user to run a file or program with the permissions of the owner of that file. This is possible by elevation of current user privileges.
* setgid is a process when executed will run as the group that owns the file.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the purpose of sticky bit?</summary><br><b>
Its a bit that only allows the owner or the root user to delete or modify the file.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What the following commands do?

  * chmod
  * chown
  * chgrp</summary><br><b>

  * chmod - changes access permissions to files system objects
  * chown - changes the owner of file system files and directories
  * chgrp - changes the group associated with a file system object
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You try to delete a file but it fails. Name at least three different reason as to why it could happen</summary><br><b>

* No more disk space
* No more inodes
* No permissions
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is systemd?</summary><br>
<b>
Systemd is a daemon (System 'd', d stands from daemon).

A daemon is a program that runs in the background without direct control of the user, although the user can at any time
talk to the daemon.

systemd has many features such as user processes control/tracking, snapshot support, inhibitor locks..


If we visualize the unix/linux system in layers, systemd would fall directly after the linux kernel.

#### Linux Kernel

<details>
<summary>What is a kernel, and what does it do?</summary><br><b>

The kernel is part of the operating system and is responsible for tasks like:

  * Allocating memory
  * Schedule processes
  * Control CPU
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you find out which Kernel version your system is using?</summary><br><b>

`uname -a` command
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Linux kernel module and how do you load a new module?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain user space vs. kernel space</summary><br><b>

The operating system executes the kernel in protected memory to prevent anyone from changing (and risking it crashing). This is what is known as "Kernel space".
"User space" is where users executes their commands or applications. It's important to create this separation since we can't rely on user applications to not tamper with the kernel, causing it to crash.

Applications can access system resources and indirectly the kernel space by making what is called "system calls".

`ps -ef`
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to run a process in the background and why to do that in the first place?</summary><br><b>

You can achieve that by specifying & at the end of the command.
As to why, since some commands/processes can take a lot of time to finish
execution or run forever, you may want to run them in the background instead of waiting for them to finish before gaining control again in current session.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How can you find how much memory a specific process consumes?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What signal is used by default when you run 'kill *process id*'?</summary><br><b>
<pre>
The default signal is SIGTERM (15). This signal kills
process gracefully which means it allows it to save current
state configuration.
</pre>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What signals are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

SIGTERM - default signal for terminating a process
SIGHUP - common usage is for reloading configuration
SIGKILL - a signal which cannot caught or ignored

To view all available signals run `kill -l`
</b></details>

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the possible states of a process in Linux?</summary><br><b>
<pre>
Running (R)
Uninterruptible Sleep (D) - The process is waiting for I/O
Interruptible Sleep (S)
Stopped (T)
Dead (x)
Zombie (z)
</pre>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you kill a process in D state?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a zombie process?</summary><br><b>

A process which has finished to run but has not exited.

One reason it happens is when a parent process is programmed incorrectly. Every parent process should execute wait() to get the exit code from the child process which finished to run. But when the parent isn't checking for the child exit code, the child process can still exists although it finished to run.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to get rid of zombie processes?</summary><br><b>

You can't kill a zombie process the regular way with `kill -9` for example as it's already dead.

One way to kill zombie process is by sending SIGCHLD to the parent process telling it to terminate its child processes. This might not work if the parent process wasn't programmed properly. The invocation is `kill -s SIGCHLD [parent_pid]`

You can also try closing/terminating the parent process. This will make the zombie process a child of init (1) which does periodic cleanups and will at some point clean up the zombie process.

<summary>What is a file descriptor? What file descriptors are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>
Kerberos
File descriptor, also known as file handler, is a unique number which identifies an open file in the operating system.

In Linux (and Unix) the first three file descriptors are:
  * 0 - the default data stream for input
  * 1 - the default data stream for output
  * 2 - the default data stream for output related to errors

##### Linux DNS

<details>
<summary>How to check what is the hostname of the system?</summary><br><b>

`cat /etc/hostname`

You can also run `hostnamectl` or `hostname` but that might print only a temporary hostname. The one in the file is the permanent one.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What the file <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> is used for? What does it include?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What commands are you using for performing DNS queries (or troubleshoot DNS related issues)?</summary><br><b>

You can specify one or more of the following:

 * <code>dig</code>

 * <code>nslookup</code>
</b></details>

##### Linux Packaging

<details>
<summary>Do you have experience with packaging? (as in building packages) Can you explain how does it works?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How packages installation/removal is performed on the distribution you are using?</summary><br><b>

The answer depends on the distribution being used.

In Fedora/CentOS/RHEL/Rocky it can be done with `rpm` or `dnf` commands.
In Ubuntu it can be done with the `apt` command.
</b></details>

<details>

<details>
<summary>How to extract the content of an archive?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why do we need package managers? Why not simply creating archives and publish them?</summary><br><b>

Package managers allow you to manage packages lifecycle as in installing, removing and updating the packages.<br>
In addition, you can specify in a spec how a certain package will be installed - where to copy the files, which commands to run prior to the installation, post the installation, etc.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What can you find in /etc/services?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to make sure a Service starts automatically after a reboot or crash?</summary><br><b>

<details>
<summary>Explain the pipe() system call. What does it used for?</summary><br><b>

[Unix pipe implementation](https://toroid.org/unix-pipe-implementation)

"Pipes provide a unidirectional interprocess communication channel. A pipe has a read end and a write end. Data written to the write end of a pipe can be read from the read end of the pipe.
A pipe is created using pipe(2), which returns two file descriptors, one referring to the read end of the pipe, the other referring to the write end."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What happens when you execute <code>ls -l</code>?</summary><br><b>

* Shell reads the input using getline() which reads the input file stream and stores into a buffer as a string
* The buffer is broken down into tokens and stored in an array this way: {"ls", "-l", "NULL"}
* Shell checks if an expansion is required (in case of ls *.c)

* Once the program in memory, its execution starts. First by calling readdir()

Notes:

* getline() originates in GNU C library and used to read lines from input stream and stores those lines in the buffer

## Operating System

<details>
<summary>What is an operating system?</summary><br><b>

There are many ways to answer that. For those who look for simplicity, the book "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" offers nice version:

"responsible for making it easy to run programs (even allowing you to seemingly run many at the same time), allowing programs to share memory, enabling programs to interact with devices, and other fun stuff like that"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a kernel, and what does it do?</summary><br><b>

The kernel is part of the operating system and is responsible for tasks like:

  * Allocating memory
  * Schedule processes
  * Control CPU
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? Some pieces of the code in the kernel are loaded into protected areas of the memory so applications can't overwritten them</summary><br><b>

True
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is POSIX?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

#### Processes

<details>
<summary>Can you explain what is a process?</summary><br><b>

A process is a running program. A program is one or more instructions and the program (or process) is executed by the operating system.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>If you had to design an API for processes in an operating system, what would this API look like?</summary><br><b>

It would support the following:

* Create - allow to create new processes
* Delete - allow to remove/destroy processes
* State - allow to check the state of the process, whether it's running, stopped, waiting, etc.
* Stop - allow to stop a running process
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How a process is created?</summary><br><b>

* The OS is reading program's code and any additional relevant data
* Program's bytes are loaded into the memory or more specifically, into the address space of the process.
* Memory is allocated for program's stack (aka run-time stack). The stack also initialized by the OS with data like argv, argc and parameters to main()
* Memory is allocated for program's heap which is required for data structures like linked lists and hash tables
* I/O initialization tasks like in Unix/Linux based systems where each process has 3 file descriptors (input, output and error)
* OS is running the program, strarting from main()

Note: The loading of the program's code into the memory done lazily which means the OS loads only partial relevant pieces required for the process to run and not the entire code.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? The loading of the program into the memory is done eagerly (all at once)</summary><br><b>

False. It was true in the past but today's operating systems perform lazy loading which means only the relevant pieces required for the process to run are loaded first.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are different states of a process?</summary><br><b>

* Running - it's executing instructions
* Ready - it's ready to run but for different reasons it's on hold
* Blocked - it's waiting for some operation to complete. For example I/O disk request
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Inter Process Communication (IPC)?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

#### Concurrency

<details>
<summary>Explain what is Semaphore and what its role in operating systems</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

#### Memory

<details>
<summary>What is cache? What is buffer?</summary><br><b>

Buffer: Reserved place in RAM which is used to hold data for temporary purposes
Cache: Cache is usually used when processes reading and writing to the disk to make the process faster by making similar data used by different programs easily accessible.
</b></details>

## Virtualization

<details>
<summary>Explain what is Virtualization</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is "time sharing"?</summary><br><b>

Even when using a system with one physical CPU, it's possible to allow multiple users to work on it and run programs. This is possible with time sharing where computing resources are shared in a way it seems to the user the system has multiple CPUs but in fact it's simply one CPU shared by applying multiprogramming and multi-tasking.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is "space sharing"?</summary><br><b>

Somewhat the opposite of time sharing. While in time sharing a resource is used for a while by one entity and then the same resource can be used by another resource, in space sharing the space is shared by multiple entities but in a way it's not being transfered between them.<br>
It's used by one entity until this entity decides to get rid of it. Take for example storage. In storage, a file is your until you decide to delete it.
</b></details>

## Ansible

<details>
<summary>Describe each of the following components in Ansible, including the relationship between them:

  * Task
  * Module
  * Play
  * Playbook
  * Role</summary><br><b>

Task – a call to a specific Ansible module
Module – the actual unit of code executed by Ansible on your own host or a remote host. Modules are indexed by category (database, file, network, …) and also referred to as task plugins.

Play – One or more tasks executed on a given host(s)

Playbook – One or more plays. Each play can be executed on the same or different hosts

Role – Ansible roles allows you to group resources based on certain functionality/service such that they can be easily reused. In a role, you have directories for variables, defaults, files, templates, handlers, tasks, and metadata. You can then use the role by simply specifying it in your playbook.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How Ansible is different from other Automation tools?</summary><br><b>

Ansible is:

* Agentless
* Minimal run requirements (Python & SSH) and simple to use
* Default mode is "push" (it supports also pull)
* Focus on simpleness and ease-of-use
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What kind of automation you wouldn't do with Ansible and why?</summary><br><b>

While it's possible to provision resources with Ansible it might not be the best choice for doing so as Ansible doesn't
save state by default. So a task that creates 5 instances for example, when executed again will create additional 5 instances (unless
additional check is implemented).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an inventory file and how do you define one?</summary><br><b>

An inventory file defines hosts and/or groups of hosts on which Ansible tasks executed upon.

An example of inventory file:

```
192.168.1.2
192.168.1.3
192.168.1.4

[web_servers]
190.40.2.20
190.40.2.21
190.40.2.22
```
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a dynamic inventory file? When you would use one?</summary><br><br>

A dynamic inventory file tracks hosts from one or more sources like cloud providers and CMDB systems.

You should use one when using external sources and especially when the hosts in your environment are being automatically<br>
spun up and shut down, without you tracking every change in these sources.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you list all modules and how can you see details on a specific module?</summary><br><br>

1. Ansible online docs
2. `ansible-doc -l` for list of modules and `ansible [module_name]` for detailed information on a specific module

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are facts? How to see all the facts of a certain host?</summary><br><b>

<details>
<summary>What would be the result of the following play?</summary><br><b>

  tasks:
      - name: Print hostname
        debug:
            msg: "It's me, {{ ansible_hostname }}"
```

When given a written code, always inspect it thoroughly. If your answer is “this will fail” then you are right. We are using a fact (ansible_hostname), which is a gathered piece of information from the host we are running on. But in this case, we disabled facts gathering (gather_facts: no) so the variable would be undefined which will result in failure.

<summary>The variable 'whoami' defined in the following places:

  * role defaults -> whoami: mario
  * extra vars (variables you pass to Ansible CLI with -e) -> whoami: toad
  * host facts -> whoami: luigi
  * inventory variables (doesn’t matter which type) -> whoami: browser

According to variable precedence, which one will be used?</summary><br><b>

The right answer is ‘toad’.

Variable precedence is about how variables override each other when they set in different locations. If you didn’t experience it so far I’m sure at some point you will, which makes it a useful topic to be aware of.

In the context of our question, the order will be extra vars (always override any other variable) -> host facts -> inventory variables -> role defaults (the weakest).

Here is the order of precedence from least to greatest (the last listed variables winning prioritization):

1. command line values (eg “-u user”)
2. role defaults [[1\]](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#id15)
3. inventory file or script group vars [[2\]](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#id16)
4. inventory group_vars/all [[3\]](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#id17)
5. playbook group_vars/all [[3\]](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#id17)
6. inventory group_vars/* [[3\]](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#id17)
7. playbook group_vars/* [[3\]](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#id17)
8. inventory file or script host vars [[2\]](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#id16)
9. inventory host_vars/* [[3\]](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#id17)
10. playbook host_vars/* [[3\]](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#id17)
11. host facts / cached set_facts [[4\]](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#id18)
12. play vars
13. play vars_prompt
14. play vars_files
15. role vars (defined in role/vars/main.yml)
16. block vars (only for tasks in block)
17. task vars (only for the task)
18. include_vars
19. set_facts / registered vars
20. role (and include_role) params
21. include params
22. extra vars (always win precedence)

A full list can be found at  [PlayBook Variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#ansible-variable-precedence) . Also, note there is a significant difference between Ansible 1.x and 2.x.

<summary>For each of the following statements determine if it's true or false:

  * A module is a collection of tasks
  * It’s better to use shell or command instead of a specific module
  * Host facts override play variables
  * A role might include the following: vars, meta, and handlers
  * Dynamic inventory is generated by extracting information from external sources
  * It’s a best practice to use indention of 2 spaces instead of 4
  * ‘notify’ used to trigger handlers
  * This “hosts: all:!controllers” means ‘run only on controllers group hosts</summary><br><b>

<summary>Explain the Diffrence between Forks and Serial & Throttle.</summary><br><b>

`Serial` is like running the playbook for each host in turn, waiting for completion of the complete playbook before moving on to the next host. `forks`=1 means run the first task in a play on one host before running the same task on the next host, so the first task will be run for each host before the next task is touched. Default fork is 5 in ansible.

```
[defaults]
forks = 30
```

```
- hosts: webservers
  serial: 1
  tasks:
    - name: ...
```

Ansible also supports `throttle` This keyword limits the number of workers up to the maximum set via the forks setting or serial. This can be useful in restricting tasks that may be CPU-intensive or interact with a rate-limiting API

```
tasks:
- command: /path/to/cpu_intensive_command
  throttle: 1
```

## Terraform

<details>
<summary>Explain what Terraform is and how does it works</summary><br><b>

Read [here](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html#what-is-terraform-)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What benefits infrastructure-as-code has?</summary><br><b>

- fully automated process of provisioning, modifying and deleting your infrastructure
- version control for your infrastructure which allows you to quickly rollback to previous versions
- validate infrastructure quality and stability with automated tests and code reviews
- makes infrastructure tasks less repetitive
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why Terraform and not other technologies? (e.g. Ansible, Puppet, CloufFormation)</summary><br><b>

A common *wrong* answer is to say that Ansible and Puppet are configuration management tools
and Terraform is a provisioning tool. While technically true, it doesn't mean Ansible and Puppet can't
be used for provisioning infrastructure. Also, it doesn't explain why Terraform should be used over
CloudFormation if at all.

The benefits of Terraform over the other tools:

  * It follows the immutable infrastructure approach which has benefits like avoiding a configuration drift over time
  * Ansible and Puppet are more procedural (you mention what to execute in each step) and Terraform is declarative since you describe the overall desired state and not per resource or task. You can give the example of going from 1 to 2 servers in each tool. In Terraform you specify 2, in Ansible and puppet you have to only provision 1 additional server so you need to explicitly make sure you provision only another one server.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is "Terraform configuration"</summary><br><b>
A configuration is a root module along with a tree of child modules that are called as dependencies from the root module.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is HCL?</summary><br><b>
HCL stands for Hashicorp Configuration Language. It is the language Hashicorp made to use as the configuration language for a number of its tools, including terraform.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain each of the following:

  * Provider
  * Resource
  * Provisioner
</summary><br><b>
  * Provider is any cloud based technology - github, aws, postgresql etc - which one can make an API call to with its unique terraform provider binary to provision available services and components.<br>
  * Resources are the services and components you provision on these platforms.<br>
  * Provisioner in terraform's lingo specifically refers to configuration tools like ansible or salt-stack which are used in combination with terraform to orchestrate a system.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What <code>terraform.tfstate</code> file is used for?</summary><br><b>

It keeps track of the IDs of created resources so that Terraform knows what it is managing.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you rename an existing resource?</summary><br><b>

terraform state mv
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what the following commands do:

  * <code>terraform init</code>
  * <code>terraform plan</code>
  * <code>terraform validate</code>
  * <code>terraform apply</code>
</summary><br><b>

<code>terraform init</code> scans your code to figure which providers are you using and download them.
<code>terraform plan</code> will let you see what terraform is about to do before actually doing it.
<code>terraform validate</code> checks if configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent within a directory.
<code>terraform apply</code> will provision the resources specified in the .tf files.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to write down a variable which changes by an external source or during <code>terraform apply</code>?</summary><br><b>

You use it this way: <code>variable “my_var” {}</code>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Give an example of several Terraform best practices</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain how implicit and explicit dependencies work in Terraform</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is <code>local-exec</code> and <code>remote-exec</code> in the context of provisioners?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a "tainted resource"?</summary><br><b>

It's a resource which was successfully created but failed during provisioning. Terraform will fail and mark this resource as "tainted".
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What <code>terraform taint</code> does?</summary><br><b>
<code>terraform taint resource.id</code> manually marks the resource as tainted in the state file. So when you run <code>terraform apply</code> the next time, the resource will be destroyed and recreated.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What types of variables are supported in Terraform?</summary><br><b>

string
number
bool
list(<TYPE>)
set(<TYPE>)
map(<TYPE>)
object({<ATTR_NAME> = <TYPE>, ... })
tuple([<TYPE>, ...])
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a data source? In what scenarios for example would need to use it?</summary><br><b>
Data sources lookup or compute values that can be used elsewhere in terraform configuration.

There are quite a few cases you might need to use them:
* you want to reference resources not managed through terraform
* you want to reference resources managed by a different terraform module
* you want to cleanly compute a value with typechecking, such as with <code>aws_iam_policy_document</code>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are output variables and what <code>terraform output</code> does?</summary><br><b>
Output variables are named values that are sourced from the attributes of a module. They are stored in terraform state, and can be used by other modules through <code>remote_state</code>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Modules</summary>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the Terraform Registry?</summary><br><b>

<details>
<summary>Explain <code>remote-exec</code> and <code>local-exec</code></summary><br><b>
</b></details>


<details>
<summary>Explain "Remote State". When would you use it and how?</summary><br><b>
  Terraform generates a `terraform.tfstate` json file that describes components/service provisioned on the specified provider. Remote
  State stores this file in a remote storage media to enable collaboration amongst team.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain "State Locking"</summary><br><b>
  State locking is a mechanism that blocks an operations against a specific state file from multiple callers so as to avoid conflicting operations from different team members. Once the first caller's operation's lock is released the other team member may go ahead to
  carryout his own operation. Nevertheless Terraform will first check the state file to see if the desired resource already exist and
  if not it goes ahead to create it.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the "Random" provider? What is it used for</summary><br><b>
 The random provider aids in generating numeric or alphabetic characters to use as a prefix or suffix for a desired named identifier.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you test a terraform module?</summary><br><b>
  Many examples are acceptable, but the most common answer would likely to be using the tool <code>terratest</code>, and to test that a module can be initialized, can create resources, and can destroy those resources cleanly.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Aside from <code>.tfvars</code> files or CLI arguments, how can you inject dependencies from other modules?</summary><br><b>
  The built-in terraform way would be to use <code>remote-state</code> to lookup the outputs from other modules.
  It is also common in the community to use a tool called <code>terragrunt</code> to explicitly inject variables between modules.
</b></details>

## Docker

<details>
<summary>What is Docker? What is it used for?</summary><br><b>
Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How are containers different from virtual machines (VMs)?</summary><br><b>

The primary difference between containers and VMs is that containers allow you to virtualize
multiple workloads on the operating system while in the case of VMs the hardware is being virtualized to
run multiple machines each with its own OS.

* Containers don't require an entire guest operating system as VMs
* It usually takes a few seconds to set up a container as opposed to VMs which can take minutes or at least more time than containers as there is an entire OS to boot and initialize as opposed to container where you mainly lunch the app itself
* Containers are isolated from each other, but not as concretely as virtual machines. It is possible for a malicious user to break into the host OS from a container and vice versa.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>In which scenarios would you use containers and in which you would prefer to use VMs?</summary><br><b>

You should choose VMs when:
  * you need run an application which requires all the resources and functionalities of an OS
  * you need full isolation and security

You should choose containers when:
  * you need a lightweight solution
  * Running multiple versions or instances of a single application
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Docker architecture</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe in detail what happens when you run `docker run hello-world`?</summary><br><b>

Docker CLI passes your request to Docker daemon.
Docker daemon downloads the image from Docker Hub
Docker daemon creates a new container by using the image it downloaded
Docker daemon redirects output from container to Docker CLI which redirects it to the standard output
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are `dockerd, docker-containerd, docker-runc, docker-containerd-ctr, docker-containerd-shim` ?</summary><br><b>

dockerd - The Docker daemon itself. The highest level component in your list and also the only 'Docker' product listed. Provides all the nice UX features of Docker.

(docker-)containerd - Also a daemon, listening on a Unix socket, exposes gRPC endpoints. Handles all the low-level container management tasks, storage, image distribution, network attachment, etc...

(docker-)containerd-ctr - A lightweight CLI to directly communicate with containerd. Think of it as how 'docker' is to 'dockerd'.

(docker-)runc - A lightweight binary for actually running containers. Deals with the low-level interfacing with Linux capabilities like cgroups, namespaces, etc...

(docker-)containerd-shim - After runC actually runs the container, it exits (allowing us to not have any long-running processes responsible for our containers). The shim is the component which sits between containerd and runc to facilitate this.

<details>
<summary>Describe difference between cgroups and namespaces </summary><br><b>
cgroup: Control Groups provide a mechanism for aggregating/partitioning sets of tasks, and all their future children, into hierarchical groups with specialized behaviour.
namespace: wraps a global system resource in an abstraction that makes it appear to the processes within the namespace that they have their own isolated instance of the global resource.

In short:

Cgroups = limits how much you can use;
namespaces = limits what you can see (and therefore use)

Cgroups involve resource metering and limiting:
memory
CPU
block I/O
network

Namespaces provide processes with their own view of the system

Multiple namespaces: pid,net, mnt, uts, ipc, user

2. The docker system prune command will remove all stopped containers, all dangling images, and all unused networks
3. docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) - This command will delete all stopped containers. The command docker ps -a -q will return all existing container IDs and pass them to the rm command which will delete them. Any running containers will not be deleted.
</b></details>

##### Dockerfile

<details>
<summary>What is Dockerfile</summary><br><b>

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between ADD and COPY in Dockerfile?</summary><br><b>

COPY takes in a src and destination. It only lets you copy in a local file or directory from your host (the machine building the Docker image) into the Docker image itself.
ADD lets you do that too, but it also supports 2 other sources. First, you can use a URL instead of a local file / directory. Secondly, you can extract a tar file from the source directly into the destination.
Although ADD and COPY are functionally similar, generally speaking, COPY is preferred. That’s because it’s more transparent than ADD. COPY only supports the basic copying of local files into the container, while ADD has some features (like local-only tar extraction and remote URL support) that are not immediately obvious.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between CMD and RUN in Dockerfile?</summary><br><b>

RUN lets you execute commands inside of your Docker image. These commands get executed once at build time and get written into your Docker image as a new layer.
CMD is the command the container executes by default when you launch the built image. A Dockerfile can only have one CMD.
You could say that CMD is a Docker run-time operation, meaning it’s not something that gets executed at build time. It happens when you run an image. A running image is called a container.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Do you perform any checks or testing related to your Dockerfile?</summary><br><b>

A common answer to this is to use [hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) project which is a linter based on Dockerfile best practices.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is Docker compose and what is it used for</summary><br><b>

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

For example, you can use it to set up ELK stack where the services are: elasticsearch, logstash and kibana. Each running in its own container.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the process of using Docker Compose</summary><br><br>

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Docker Hub?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between Docker Hub and Docker cloud?</summary><br><b>

Docker Hub is a native Docker registry service which allows you to run pull
and push commands to install and deploy Docker images from the Docker Hub.

Docker Cloud is built on top of the Docker Hub so Docker Cloud provides
you with more options/features compared to Docker Hub. One example is
Swarm management which means you can create new swarms in Docker Cloud.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Docker Repository?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain image layers</summary><br><b>

A Docker image is built up from a series of layers. Each layer represents an instruction in the image’s Dockerfile. Each layer except the very last one is read-only.
Each layer is only a set of differences from the layer before it. The layers are stacked on top of each other. When you create a new container, you add a new writable layer on top of the underlying layers. This layer is often called the “container layer”. All changes made to the running container, such as writing new files, modifying existing files, and deleting files, are written to this thin writable container layer.
The major difference between a container and an image is the top writable layer. All writes to the container that add new or modify existing data are stored in this writable layer. When the container is deleted, the writable layer is also deleted. The underlying image remains unchanged.
Because each container has its own writable container layer, and all changes are stored in this container layer, multiple containers can share access to the same underlying image and yet have their own data state.

## Kubernetes

<a name="kubernetes"></a>

<details>
<summary>What is Kubernetes? Why organizations are using it?</summary><br><b>

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

To understand what Kubernetes is good for, let's look at some examples:

* You would like to run a certain application in a container on multiple different locations. Sure, if it's 2-3 servers/locations, you can do it by yourself but it can be challenging to scale it up to additional multiple location.<br>
* Performing updates and changes across hundreds of containers<br>
* Handle cases where the current load requires to scale up (or down)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Kubernetes Cluster?</summary><br><b>

Red Hat Definition: "A Kubernetes cluster is a set of node machines for running containerized applications. If you’re running Kubernetes, you’re running a cluster.

At a minimum, a cluster contains a worker node and a master node."

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Node?</summary><br><b>

A node is a virtual machine or a physical server that serves as a worker for running the applications.
It's recommended to have at least 3 nodes in Kubernetes production environment.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What the master node is responsible for?</summary><br><b>

The master coordinates all the workflows in the cluster:

* Scheduling applications
* Managing desired state
* Rolling out new updates
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What do we need worker nodes for?</summary><br><b>

The workers are the nodes which run the applications and workloads.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? Every cluster must have 0 or more master nodes and 1 or more workers</summary><br><b>

False. A Kubernetes cluster consists of at least 1 master and 0 or more workers.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is a pod</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the components of the master node?</summary><br><b>

  * API Server - the Kubernetes API. All cluster components communicate through it
  * Scheduler - assigns an application with a worker node it can run on
  * Controller Manager - cluster maintenance (replications, node failures, etc.)
  * etcd - stores cluster configuration
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? The API server is the only component which communicates directly with etcd</summary><br><b>

True
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the components of a worker node?</summary><br><b>

  * Kubelet - an agent responsible for node communication with the master.
  * Kube-proxy - load balancing traffic between app components
  * Container runtime - the engine runs the containers (Podman, Docker, ...)
</b></details>

<summary>What is kubectl?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are namespaces? Why would someone use namespaces?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? When a namespace is deleted all resources in that namespace are not deleted but moved to another default namespace</summary><br><b>

False. When a namespace is deleted, the resources in that namespace are deleted as well.

#### Scheduling

<details>
<summary> How does scheduling work in kubernetes?</summary><br><b>

The control plane component kube-scheduler asks the following questions,
1. What to schedule? It tries to understand the pod-definition specifications
2. Which node to schedule? It tries to determine the best node with available resources to spin a pod
3. Binds the Pod to a given node

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you monitor your Kubernetes?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You suspect one of the pods is having issues, what do you do?</summary><br><b>

Start by inspecting the pods status. we can use the command `kubectl get pods` (--all-namespaces for pods in system namespace)<br>

If we see "Error" status, we can keep debugging by running the command `kubectl describe pod [name]`. In case we still don't see anything useful we can try stern for log tailing.<br>

In case we find out there was a temporary issue with the pod or the system, we can try restarting the pod with the following `kubectl scale deployment [name] --replicas=0`<br>

Setting the replicas to 0 will shut down the process. Now start it with `kubectl scale deployment [name] --replicas=1`

<summary>Are you familiar with SOLID design principles?</summary><br><b>

SOLID design principles are about:

* Make it easier to extend the functionality of the system
* Make the code more readable and easier to maintain

SOLID is:

* Single Responsibility - A class should only have a single responsibility
* Open-Closed - An entity should be open for extension, but closed for modification. What this practically means is that you should extend functionality by adding a new code and not by modifying it. Your system should be separated into components so it can be easily extended without breaking everything.
* Liskov Substitution - Any derived class should be able to substitute the its parent without altering its corrections. Practically, every part of the code will get the expected result no matter which part is using it
* Interface segregation - A client should never depend on anything it doesn't uses
* Dependency Inversion - High level modules should depend on abstractions, not low level modules

##### Common algorithms

<details>
<summary>Binary search:

  * How does it works?
  * Can you implement it? (in any language you prefer)
  * What is the average performance of the algorithm you wrote?</summary><br><b>

It's a search algorithm used with sorted arrays/lists to find a target value by dividing the array each iteration and comparing the middle value to the target value. If the middle value is smaller than target value, then the target value is searched in the right part of the divided array, else in the left side. This continues until the value is found (or the array divided max times)

[python implementation](coding/python/binary_search.py)

The average performance of the above algorithm is O(log n). Best performance can be O(1) and worst O(log n).

## Python

<details>
<summary>What are some characteristics of the Python programming language?</summary><br><b>

```
1. It is a high level general purpose programming language created in 1991 by Guido Van Rosum.
2. The language is interpreted, being the CPython (Written in C) the most used/maintained implementation.
3. It is strongly typed. The typing discipline is duck typing and gradual.
4. Python focuses on readability and makes use of whitespaces/identation instead of brackets { }
5. The python package manager is called PIP "pip installs packages", having more than 200.000 available packages.
6. Python comes with pip installed and a big standard library that offers the programmer many precooked solutions.
7. In python **Everything** is an object.

There are many other characteristics but these are the main ones that every python programmer should know.

<summary>In Python, functions are first-class objects. What does it mean?</summary><br><b>

In general, first class objects in programming languages are objects which can be assigned to variable, used as a return value and can be used as arguments or parameters.<br>
In python you can treat functions this way. Let's say we have the following function

```
def my_function():
    return 5
```

You can then assign a function to a variables like this `x = my_function` or you can return functions as return values like this `return my_function`

<details>
<summary>Explain inheritance and how to use it in Python</summary><br><b>

```
By definition inheritance is the mechanism where an object acts as a base of another object, retaining all its
properties.

So if Class B inherits from Class A, every characteristics from class A will be also available in class B.
Class A would be the 'Base class' and B class would be the 'derived class'.

This comes handy when you have several classes that share the same functionalities.

The basic syntax is:

class Base: pass

class Derived(Base): pass

A more forged example:

class Animal:
    def __init__(self):
        print("and I'm alive!")

    def eat(self, food):
        print("ñom ñom ñom", food)

class Human(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        print('My name is ', name)
        super().__init__()

    def write_poem(self):
        print('Foo bar bar foo foo bar!')

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        print('My name is', name)
        super().__init__()

    def bark(self):
        print('woof woof')


michael = Human('Michael')
michael.eat('Spam')
michael.write_poem()

bruno = Dog('Bruno')
bruno.eat('bone')
bruno.bark()

>>> My name is  Michael
>>> and I'm alive!
>>> ñom ñom ñom Spam
>>> Foo bar bar foo foo bar!
>>> My name is Bruno
>>> and I'm alive!
>>> ñom ñom ñom bone
>>> woof woof

Calling super() calls the Base method, thus, calling super().__init__() we called the Animal __init__.

There is a more advanced python feature called MetaClasses that aid the programmer to directly control class creation.

<summary>What is an error? What is an exception? What types of exceptions are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

```
#  Note that you generally don't need to know the compiling process but knowing where everything comes from
#  and giving complete answers shows that you truly know what you are talking about.

Generally, every compiling process have a two steps.
    - Analysis
    - Code Generation.

    Analysis can be broken into:
        1. Lexical analysis   (Tokenizes source code)
        2. Syntactic analysis (Check whether the tokens are legal or not, tldr, if syntax is correct)

               for i in 'foo'
                          ^
             SyntaxError: invalid syntax

        We missed ':'


        3. Semantic analysis  (Contextual analysis, legal syntax can still trigger errors, did you try to divide by 0,
          hash a mutable object or use an undeclared function?)

                 1/0
                ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

    These three analysis steps are the responsible for error handlings.

    The second step would be responsible for errors, mostly syntax errors, the most common error.
    The third step would be responsible for Exceptions.

    As we have seen, Exceptions are semantic errors, there are many builtin Exceptions:

        ImportError
        ValueError
        KeyError
        FileNotFoundError
        IndentationError
        IndexError
        ...

    You can also have user defined Exceptions that have to inherit from the `Exception` class, directly or indirectly.

    Basic example:

    class DividedBy2Error(Exception):
        def __init__(self, message):
            self.message = message


    def division(dividend,divisor):
        if divisor == 2:
            raise DividedBy2Error('I dont want you to divide by 2!')
        return dividend / divisor

    division(100, 2)

    >>> __main__.DividedBy2Error: I dont want you to divide by 2!
```
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Exception Handling and how to use it in Python</summary><br><b>

**Exceptions:** Errors detected during execution are called Exceptions.

**Handling Exception:** When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message.</br>
Exceptions can be handled using `try` and `except` statement in python.

**Example:** Following example asks the user for input until a valid integer has been entered. </br>
If user enter a non-integer value it will raise exception and using except it will catch that exception and ask the user to enter valid integer again.


```py
while True:
    try:
        a = int(input("please enter an integer value: "))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Ops! Please enter a valid integer value.")

```

<summary>What is Lambda? How is it used?</summary><br><b>

A <code>lambda</code> expression is an 'anonymous' function, the difference from a normal defined function using the keyword `def`` is the syntax and usage.

The syntax is:

```lambda[parameters]: [expresion]```

**Examples:**

* A lambda function add 10 with any argument passed.

```py
x = lambda a: a + 10
print(x(10))
```

* An addition function

```py
addition = lambda x, y: x + y
print(addition(10, 20))
```

* Squaring function

```py
square = lambda x : x ** 2

<summary>How to check if all the elements in a given lists are unique? so [1, 2, 3] is unique but [1, 1, 2, 3] is not unique because 1 exists twice</summary><br><b>
</b>

There are many ways of solving this problem:<br>
<code># Note: :list and -> bool are just python typings, they are not needed for the correct execution of the algorithm. </code>

Taking advantage of sets and len:

```
def is_unique(l:list) -> bool:
    return len(set(l)) == len(l)
```

This one is can be seen used in other programming languages.

```
def is_unique2(l:list) -> bool:
    seen = []

    for i in l:
        if i in seen:
            return False
        seen.append(i)
    return True
```

Here we just count and make sure every element is just repeated once.

```
def is_unique3(l:list) -> bool:
    for i in l:
        if l.count(i) > 1:
            return False
    return True
```

This one might look more convulated but hey, one liners.

<summary>What empty <code>return</code> returns?</summary><br><b>
</b>

Short answer is: It returns a None object.

We could go a bit deeper and explain the difference between

```
def a ():
    return

>>> None
```

And

```
def a ():
    pass

>>> None
```
Or we could be asked this as a following question, since they both give the same result.

We could use the dis module to see what's going on:

```
  2           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (<code object a at 0x0000029C4D3C2DB0, file "<dis>", line 2>)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 ('a')
              4 MAKE_FUNCTION            0
              6 STORE_NAME               0 (a)

  5           8 LOAD_CONST               2 (<code object b at 0x0000029C4D3C2ED0, file "<dis>", line 5>)
             10 LOAD_CONST               3 ('b')
             12 MAKE_FUNCTION            0
             14 STORE_NAME               1 (b)
             16 LOAD_CONST               4 (None)
             18 RETURN_VALUE

Disassembly of <code object a at 0x0000029C4D3C2DB0, file "<dis>", line 2>:
  3           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
              2 RETURN_VALUE

Disassembly of <code object b at 0x0000029C4D3C2ED0, file "<dis>", line 5>:
  6           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
              2 RETURN_VALUE
```

An empty <code> return</code> is exactly the same as <code>return None</code> and functions without any explicit return
will always return None regardless of the operations, therefore


```
def sum(a, b):
    global c
    c = a + b

>>> None

<summary>Explain what is a decorator</summary><br><b>
</b>
<b>In python, everything is an object, even functions themselves. Therefore you could pass functions as arguments
for another function eg;

```
def wee(word):
    return word

def oh(f):
    return f + "Ohh"

>>> oh(wee("Wee"))
<<< Wee Ohh
```

This allows us to control the before execution of any given function and if we added another function as wrapper,
(a function receiving another function that receives a function as parameter) we could also control the after execution.

Sometimes we want to control the before-after execution of many functions and it would get tedious to write

<code> f = function(function_1())</code>
<code> f = function(function_1(function_2(*args)))</code>

every time, that's what decorators do, they introduce syntax to write all of this on the go, using the keyword '@'.

These two decorators (ntimes and timer) are usually used to display decorators functionalities, you can find them in lots of
tutorials/reviews. I first saw these examples two years ago in pyData 2017. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lmCu8wz8ro&t=3731s</code>

```
Simple decorator:

def deco(f):
    print(f"Hi I am the {f.__name__}() function!")
    return f

@deco
def hello_world():
    return "Hi, I'm in!"

a = hello_world()
print(a)

>>> Hi I am the hello_world() function!
    Hi, I'm in!
```

This is the simplest decorator version, it basically saves us from writting <code>a = deco(hello_world())</code>.
But at this point we can only control the before execution, let's take on the after:

```
def deco(f):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Rick Sanchez!")
        func = f(*args, **kwargs)
        print("I'm in!")
        return func
    return wrapper

@deco
def f(word):
    print(word)

a = f("************")
>>> Rick Sanchez!
    ************
    I'm in!
```

deco receives a function -> f
wrapper receives the arguments -> *args, **kwargs

wrapper returns the function plus the arguments -> f(*args, **kwargs)
deco returns wrapper.

As you can see we conveniently do things before and after the execution of a given function.

For example, we could write a decorator that calculates the execution time of a function.

```
import time
def deco(f):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        before = time.time()
        func = f(*args, **kwargs)
        after = time.time()
        print(after-before)
        return func
    return wrapper

@deco
def f():
    time.sleep(2)
    print("************")

a = f()
>>> 2.0008859634399414
```

Or create a decorator that executes a function n times.

```
def n_times(n):
    def wrapper(f):
        def inner(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(n):
                func = f(*args, **kwargs)
            return func
        return inner
    return wrapper

@n_times(4)
def f():
    print("************")

a = f()

>>>************
   ************
   ************
   ************
```

<summary>What is the difference between <code>git pull</code> and <code>git fetch</code>?</summary><br><b>

Shortly, git pull = git fetch + git merge

When you run git pull, it gets all the changes from the remote or central
repository and attaches it to your corresponding branch in your local repository.

git fetch gets all the changes from the remote repository, stores the changes in
a separate branch in your local repository
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the following: <code>git directory</code>, <code>working directory</code> and <code>staging area</code></summary><br><b>

The Git directory is where Git stores the meta data and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.

The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.

The staging area is a simple file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. It’s sometimes referred to as the index, but it’s becoming standard to refer to it as the staging area.

<details>
<summary>How to resolve git merge conflicts?</summary><br><b>

<p>
First, you open the files which are in conflict and identify what are the conflicts.
Next, based on what is accepted in your company or team, you either discuss with your
colleagues on the conflicts or resolve them by yourself
After resolving the conflicts, you add the files with `git add <file_name>`
Finally, you run `git rebase --continue`
</p>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between <code>git reset</code> and <code>git revert</code>?</summary><br><b>

<p>

`git revert` creates a new commit which undoes the changes from last commit.

`git reset` depends on the usage, can modify the index or change the commit which the branch head
is currently pointing at.

<summary>What merge strategies are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

Mentioning two or three should be enough and it's probably good to mention that 'recursive' is the default one.

recursive

<details>
<summary>How can you see which changes have done before committing them?</summary><br><b>

<code>git diff</code>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you revert a specific file to previous commit?</summary><br><b>

```
git checkout HEAD~1 -- /path/of/the/file

<details>
<summary>What is the <code>.git</code> directory? What can you find there?</summary><br><b>
	The <code>.git</code> folder contains all the information that is necessary for your project in version control and all the information about commits, remote repository address, etc. All of them are present in this folder. It also contains a log that stores your commit history so that you can roll back to history.

<details>
<summary>How do you remove a remote branch?</summary><br><b>

You delete a remote branch with this syntax:

git push origin :[branch_name]
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Are you familiar with gitattributes? When would you use it?</summary><br><b>

gitattributes allow you to define attributes per pathname or path pattern.<br>

You can use it for example to control endlines in files. In Windows and Unix based systems, you have different characters for new lines (\r\n and \n accordingly). So using gitattributes we can align it for both Windows and Unix with `* text=auto` in .gitattributes for anyone working with git. This is way, if you use the Git project in Windows you'll get \r\n and if you are using Unix or Linux, you'll get \n.

<details>
<summary>How do you discard local commits?</summary><br><b>

`git reset HEAD~1` for removing last commit
If you would like to also discard the changes you `git reset --hard``

## Go


<details>
<summary>What are some characteristics of the Go programming language?</summary><br><b>

  * Strong and static typing - the type of the variables can't be changed over time and they have to be defined at compile time
  * Simplicity
  * Fast compile times
  * Built-in concurrency
  * Garbage collected
  * Platform independent
  * Compile to standalone binary - anything you need to run your app will be compiled into one binary. Very useful for version management in run-time.

Go also has good community.

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between <code>var x int = 2</code> and <code>x := 2</code>?</summary><br><b>

The result is the same, a variable with the value 2.

With <code>var x int = 2</code> we are setting the variable type to integer while with <code>x := 2</code> we are letting Go figure out by itself the type.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? In Go we can redeclare variables and once declared we must use it.</summary>

False. We can't redeclare variables but yes, we must used declared variables.

func main() {
    var x int = 101
    var y string
    y = string(x)
    fmt.Println(y)
}
```
</summary><br><b>

It looks what unicode value is set at 101 and uses it for converting the integer to a string.
If you want to get "101" you should use the package "strconv" and replace <code>y = string(x)</code> with <code>y = strconv.Itoa(x)</code>

<summary>What is wrong with the following code?:

```
package main

func main() {
    var x = 2
    var y = 3
    const someConst = x + y

Constants in Go can only be declared using constant expressions.

In `mod1` a is link, and when we're using `a[i]`, we're changing `s1` value to.
But in `mod2`, `append` creats new slice, and we're changing only `a` value, not `s2`.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?</summary><br><b>

The main difference is that SQL databases are structured (data is stored in the form of
tables with rows and columns - like an excel spreadsheet table) while NoSQL is
unstructured, and the data storage can vary depending on how the NoSQL DB is set up, such
as key-value pair, document-oriented, etc.
</b></details>

<details>

## Shell Scripting

<details>
<summary>Tell me about your experience with shell scripting</summary><br><b>

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What this line in scripts mean?: <code>#!/bin/bash</code></summary><br><b>


`#!/bin/bash` is She-bang

/bin/bash is the most common shell used as default shell for user login of the linux system. The shell’s name is an acronym for Bourne-again shell. Bash can execute the vast majority of scripts and thus is widely used because it has more features, is well developed and better syntax.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What do you tend to include in every script you write?</summary><br><b>

Few example:

  * Comments on how to run it and/or what it does
  * Adding "set -e" since I want the script to exit if a certain command failed

You can have an entirely different answer. It's based only on your experience.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False?: when a certain command/line fails, the script, by default, will exit and will no keep running</summary><br><b>

Depends on the language and settings used.
When a script written in Bash fails to run a certain command it will keep running and will execute all other commands mentioned after the command which failed.
Most of the time we would actually want the opposite to happen. In order to make Bash exist when a specific command fails, use 'set -e' in your script.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Today we have tools and technologies like Ansible. Why would someone still use shell scripting?</summary><br><b>

  * Speed
  * The module we need doesn't exist
  * We are delivering the scripts to customers who don't have access to the public network and don't necessarily have Ansible installed on their systems.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what would be the result of each command:

  * <code>echo $0</code>
  * <code>echo $?</code>
  * <code>echo $$</code>
  * <code>echo $@</code>
  * <code>echo $#</code></summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you debug shell scripts?</summary><br><b>

Answer depends on the language you are using for writing your scripts. If Bash is used for example then:

  * Adding -x to the script I'm running in Bash
  * Old good way of adding echo statements

If Python, then using pdb is very useful.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you get input from the user in shell scripts?</summary><br><b>

Using the keyword <code>read</code> so for example <code>read x</code> will wait for user input and will store it in the variable x.

## SQL

<details>
<summary>What does SQL stand for?</summary><br><b>

Structured Query Language

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How is SQL Different from NoSQL</summary><br><b>

The main difference is that SQL databases are structured (data is stored in the form of
tables with rows and columns - like an excel spreadsheet table) while NoSQL is
unstructured, and the data storage can vary depending on how the NoSQL DB is set up, such
as key-value pair, document-oriented, etc.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What does it mean when a database is ACID compliant?</summary><br>

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. In order to be ACID compliant, the database much meet each of the four criteria

**Atomicity** - When a change occurs to the database, it should either succeed or fail as a whole.

For example, if you were to update a table, the update should completely execute. If it only partially executes, the
update is considered failed as a whole, and will not go through - the DB will revert back to it's original
state before the update occurred. It should also be mentioned that Atomicity ensures that each
transaction is completed as it's own stand alone "unit" - if any part fails, the whole statement fails.

**Consistency** - any change made to the database should bring it from one valid state into the next.

For example, if you make a change to the DB, it shouldn't corrupt it. Consistency is upheld by checks and constraints that
are pre-defined in the DB. For example, if you tried to change a value from a string to an int when the column
should be of datatype string, a consistent DB would not allow this transaction to go through, and the action would
not be executed

**Isolation** - this ensures that a database will never be seen "mid-update" - as multiple transactions are running at
the same time, it should still leave the DB in the same state as if the transactions were being run sequentially.

For example, let's say that 20 other people were making changes to the database at the same time. At the
time you executed your query, 15 of the 20 changes had gone through, but 5 were still in progress. You should
only see the 15 changes that had completed - you wouldn't see the database mid-update as the change goes through.

**Durability** - Once a change is committed, it will remain committed regardless of what happens
(power failure, system crash, etc.). This means that all completed transactions
must be recorded in non-volatile memory.

Note that SQL is by nature ACID compliant. Certain NoSQL DB's can be ACID compliant depending on
how they operate, but as a general rule of thumb, NoSQL DB's are not considered ACID compliant
</details>

<details>
<summary>When is it best to use SQL? NoSQL?</summary><br><b>

SQL - Best used when data integrity is crucial. SQL is typically implemented with many
businesses and areas within the finance field due to it's ACID compliance.

NoSQL - Great if you need to scale things quickly. NoSQL was designed with web applications
in mind, so it works great if you need to quickly spread the same information around to
multiple servers

Additionally, since NoSQL does not adhere to the strict table with columns and rows structure
that Relational Databases require, you can store different data types together.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Cartesian Product?</summary><br>

A Cartesian product is when all rows from the first table are joined to all rows in the second
table. This can be done implicitly by not defining a key to join, or explicitly by
calling a CROSS JOIN on two tables, such as below:

Select * from customers **CROSS JOIN** orders;

Note that a Cartesian product can also be a bad thing - when performing a join
on two tables in which both do not have unique keys, this could cause the returned information
to be incorrect.
</details>

100204 | X202 | Coffee | 20.00 | 2019-04-29

<details>
<summary>How would I select all fields from this table?</summary><br><b>

Select * <br>
From Customers;
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How many items are in John's cart?</summary><br><b>

Select Items_in_cart <br>
From Customers <br>
Where Customer_Name = "John Smith";
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the sum of all the cash spent across all customers?</summary><br><b>

Select SUM(Cash_spent_to_Date) as SUM_CASH <br>
From Customers;
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How many people have items in their cart?</summary><br><b>

Select count(1) as Number_of_People_w_items <br>
From Customers <br>
where Items_in_cart > 0;
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you join the customer table to the order table?</summary><br><b>

You would join them on the unique key. In this case, the unique key is Customer_ID in
both the Customers table and Orders table
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you show which customer ordered which items?</summary><br><b>

Select c.Customer_Name, o.Item <br>
From Customers c <br>
Left Join Orders o <br>
  On c.Customer_ID = o.Customer_ID;

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Using a with statement, how would you show who ordered cat food, and the total amount of money spent?</summary><br><b>

with cat_food as ( <br>
Select Customer_ID, SUM(Price) as TOTAL_PRICE <br>
From Orders <br>
Where Item like "%Cat Food%" <br>
Group by Customer_ID <br>
) <br>
Select Customer_name, TOTAL_PRICE <br>
From Customers c <br>
Inner JOIN cat_food f <br>
  ON c.Customer_ID = f.Customer_ID <br>
where c.Customer_ID in (Select Customer_ID from cat_food);

Although this was a simple statement, the "with" clause really shines when
a complex query needs to be run on a table before joining to another. With statements are nice,
because you create a pseudo temp when running your query, instead of creating a whole new table.

The Sum of all the purchases of cat food weren't readily available, so we used a with statement to create
the pseudo table to retrieve the sum of the prices spent by each customer, then join the table normally.

### Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

<details>
<summary>What is GKE</summary><br><b>

* It is the managed kubernetes service on GCP for deploying, managing and scaling containerised applications using Google infrastructure.
</b></details>

### Anthos

<details>
<summary>What is Anthos</summary><br><b>
It is a managed application platform for organisations like enterprises that require quick modernisation and certain levels
of consistency for their legacy applications in a hybrid or multicloud world. From this explanation the core ideas can be drawn from these statements;

* Managed -> the customer does not need to worry about the underlying software intergrations, they just enable the API.
* application platform -> It consists of open source tools like K8s, Knative, Istio and Tekton
* Enterprises -> these are usually organisations with complex needs
* Consistency -> to have the same policies declaratively initiated to be run anywhere securely e.g on-prem, GCP or other-clouds (AWS or Azure)

fun fact: Anthos is flower in greek, they grow in the ground (earth) but need rain from the clouds to flourish.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>List the technical components that make up Anthos</summary><br><b>

* Infrastructure management - Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
* Cluster management - GKE, Ingress for Anthos
* Service management - Anthos Service Mesh
* Policy enforcement - Anthos Config Management, Anthos Enterprise Data Protection, Policy Controller
* Application deployment - CI/CD tools like Cloud Build, GitLab
* Application development - Cloud Code
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the primary computing environment for Anthos to easily manage workload deployment?</summary><br><b>

* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does Anthos handle the control plane and node components for GKE?</summary><br><b>

On GCP the kubernetes api-server is the only control plane component exposed to customers whilst compute engine manages
instances in the project.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Which load balancing options are available?</summary><br><b>

* Networking load balancing for L4 and HTTP(S) Load Balancing for L7 which are both managed services that do not require
  additional configuration.
* Ingress for Anthos which allows the ability to deploy a load balancer that serves an application across multiple clusters
  on GKE
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Can you deploy Anthos on AWS?</summary><br><b>

* Yes, Anthos on AWS is now GA. For more read [here](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/gke/docs/aws)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>List and explain the enterprise security capabilities provided by Anthos</summary><br><b>

* Control plane security - GCP manages and maintains the K8s control plane out of the box. The user can secure the api-server by using master authorized networks and private clusters. These allow the user to disable access on the public IP address by assigning a private IP address to the master.
* Node security - By default workloads are provisioned on Compute engine instances that use Google's Container Optimised OS. This operating system implements a locked-down firewall, limited user accounts with root disabled and a read-only filesystem. There is a further option to enable GKE Sandbox for stronger isolation in multi-tenant deployment scenarios.
* Network security - Within a created cluster VPC, Anthos GKE leverages a powerful software-defined network that enables simple Pod-to-Pod communications. Network policies allow locking down ingress and egress connections in a given namespace. Filtering can also be implemented to incoming load-balanced traffic for services that require external access, by supplying whitelisted CIDR IP ranges.
* Workload security - Running workloads run with limited privileges, default Docker AppArmor security policies are applied to all Kubernetes Pods. Workload identity for Anthos GKE aligns with the open source kubernetes service accounts with GCP service account permissions.
* Audit logging - Adminstrators are given a way to retain, query, process and alert on events of the deployed environments.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How can workloads deployed on Anthos GKE on-prem clusters securely connect to Google Cloud services?</summary><br><b>

* Google Cloud Virtual Private Network (Cloud VPN) - this is for secure networking
* Google Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS) - for key management
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Island Mode configuration with regards to networking in Anthos GKE deployed on-prem?</summary><br><b>

* This is when pods can directly talk to each other within a cluster, but cannot be reached from outside the cluster thus forming an "island" within the network that is not connected to the external network.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Anthos Config Management</summary><br><b>

It is a core component of the Anthos stack which provides platform, service and security operators with a single, unified approach to multi-cluster management that spans both on-premises and cloud environments. It closely follows K8s best practices, favoring declarative approaches over imperative operations, and actively monitors cluster state and applies the desired state as defined in Git. It includes three key components as follows:

1. An importer that reads from a central Git repository
2. A component that synchronises stored configuration data into K8s objects
3. A component that monitors drift between desired and actual cluster configurations with a capability of reconciliation when need rises.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does Anthos Config Management help?</summary><br><b>

It follows common modern software development practices which makes cluster configuration, management and policy changes auditable, revertable, and versionable easily enforcing IT governance and unifying resource management in an organisation.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Anthos Service Mesh?</summary><br><b>

* It is a suite of tools that assist in monitoring and managing deployed services on Anthos of all shapes and sizes whether running in cloud, hybrid or multi-cloud environments. It leverages the APIs and core components from Istio, a highly configurable and open-source service mesh platform.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the two main components of Anthos Service Mesh</summary><br><b>

1. Data plane - it consists of a set of distributed proxies that mediate all inbound and outbound network traffic between individual services which are configured using a centralised control plane and an open API
2. Control plane - is a fully managed offering outside of Anthos GKE clusters to simplify management overhead and ensure highest possible availability.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the components of the managed control plane of Anthos Service Mesh?</summary><br><b>

1. Traffic Director - it is GCP's fully managed service mesh traffic control plane, responsible for translating Istio API objects into configuration information for the distributed proxies, as well as directing service mesh ingress and egress traffic
2. Managed CA - is a centralised certificate authority responsible for providing SSL certificates to each of the distributed proxies, authentication information and distributing secrets
3. Operations tooling - formerly stackdriver, provides a managed ingestion point for observability and telemetry, specifically monitoring, tracing and logging data generated by each of the proxies. This powers the observability dashboard for operators to visually inspect their services and service dependencies assisting in the implementation of SRE best practices for monitoring SLIs and establishing SLOs.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does Anthos Service Mesh help?</summary><br><b>
Tool and technology integration that makes up Anthos service mesh delivers signficant operational benefits to Anthos environments, with minimal additional overhead such as follows:

* Uniform observability - the data plane reports service to service communication back to the control plane generating a service dependency graph. Traffic inspection by the proxy inserts headers to facilitate distributed tracing, capturing and reporting service logs together with service-level metrics (i.e latency, errors, availability).
* Operational agility - fine-grained controls for managing the flow of inter-mesh (north-south) and intra-mesh (east-west) traffic are provided.
* Policy-driven security - policies can be enforced consistently across diverse protocols and runtimes as service communications are secured by default.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>List possible use cases of traffic controls that can be implemented within Anthos Service Mesh</summary><br><b>

* Traffic splitting across differing service versions for canary or A/B testing
* Circuit breaking to prevent cascading failures
* Fault injection to help build resilient and fault-tolerant deployments
* HTTP header-based traffic steering between individual services or versions
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Cloud Run for Anthos?</summary><br><b>

It is part of the Anthos stack that brings a serverless container experience to Anthos, offering a high-level platform experience on top of K8s clusters. It is built with Knative, an open-source operator for K8s that brings serverless application serving and eventing capabilities.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does Cloud Run for Anthos simplify operations?</summary><br><b>

Platform teams in organisations that wish to offer developers additional tools to test, deploy and run applications can use Knative to enhance this experience on Anthos as Cloud Run. Below are some of the benefits;

* Easy migration from K8s deployments - Without Cloud Run, platform engineers have to configure deployment, service, and HorizontalPodAutoscalers(HPA) objects to a loadbalancer and autoscaling. If application is already serving traffic it becomes hard to change configurations or roll back efficiently. Using Cloud Run all this is managed thus the Knative service manifest describes the application to be autoscaled and loadbalanced
* Autoscaling - a sudden traffic spike may cause application containers in K8s to crash due to overload thus an efficient automated autoscaling is executed to serve the high volume of traffic
* Networking - it has built-in load balancing capabilities and policies for traffic splitting between multiple versions of an application.
* Releases and rollouts - supports the notion of the Knatibe API's revisions which describe new versions or different configurations of your application and canary deployments by splitting traffic.
* Monitoring - observing and recording metrics such as latency, error rate and requests per second.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>List and explain three high-level out of the box autoscaling primitives offered by Cloud Run for Anthos that do not exist in K8s natively</summary><br><b>

* Rapid, request-based autoscaling - default autoscalers monitor request metrics which allows Cloud Run for Anthos to handle spiky traffic patterns smoothly
* Concurrency controls - limits such as max in-flight requests per container are enforced to ensure the container does not become overloaded and crash. More containers are added to handle the spiky traffic, buffering the requests.
* Scale to zero - if an application is inactive for a while Cloud Run scales it down to zero to reduce its footprint. Alternatively one can turn off scale-to-zero to prevent cold starts.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>List some Cloud Run for Anthos use cases</summary><br><b>
As it does not support stateful applications or sticky sessions, it is suitable for running stateless applications such as:

* Machine learning model predictions e.g Tensorflow serving containers
* API gateways, API middleware, web front ends and Microservices
* Event handlers, ETL

<summary>What is XSS?</summary><br><b>

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is an type of a attack when the attacker inserts browser executable code within a HTTP response. Now the injected attack is not stored in the web application, it will only affact the users who open the maliciously crafted link or third-party web page. A successful attack allows the attacker to access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site 

You can test by detecting user-defined variables and how to input them. This includes hidden or non-obvious inputs such as HTTP parameters, POST data, hidden form field values, and predefined radio or selection values. You then analyze each found vector to see if their are potential vulnerabilities, then when found you craft input data with each input vector. Then you test the crafted input and see if it works.

<summary>What is an SQL injection? How to manage it?</summary><br><b>

SQL injection is an attack consists of inserts either a partial or full SQL query through data input from the browser to the web application. When a successful SQL injection happens it will allow the attacker to read sensitive information stored on the database for the web application. 

You can test by using a stored procedure, so the application must be sanitize the user input to get rid of the tisk of code injection. If not then the user could enter bad SQL, that will then be executed within the procedure

DNS spoofing occurs when a particular DNS server’s records of “spoofed” or altered maliciously to redirect traffic to the attacker. This redirection of traffic allows the attacker to spread malware, steal data, etc.

**Prevention**
- Use encrypted data transfer protocols - Using end-to-end encryption vian SSL/TLS will help decrease the chance that a website / its visitors are compromised by DNS spoofing.
- Use DNSSEC - DNSSEC, or Domain Name System Security Extensions, uses digitally signed DNS records to help determine data authenticity.
- Implement DNS spoofing detection mechanisms - it’s important to implement DNS spoofing detection software. Products such as XArp help product against ARP cache poisoning by inspecting the data that comes through before transmitting it.

## Elastic

<details>
<summary>What is the Elastic Stack?</summary><br><b>

The Elastic Stack consists of:

  * Elasticsearch
  * Kibana
  * Logstash
  * Beats
  * Elastic Hadoop
  * APM Server

Elasticserach, Logstash and Kibana are also known as the ELK stack.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is Elasticsearch</summary><br><b>

From the official [docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/documents-indices.html):

"Elasticsearch is a distributed document store. Instead of storing information as rows of columnar data, Elasticsearch stores complex data structures that have been serialized as JSON documents"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Logstash?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what beats are</summary><br><b>

Beats are lightweight data shippers. These data shippers installed on the client where the data resides.
Examples of beats: Filebeat, Metricbeat, Auditbeat. There are much more.<br>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Kibana?</summary><br><b>

From the official docs:

"Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch. You use Kibana to search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices. You can easily perform advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables, and maps."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe what happens from the moment an app logged some information until it's displayed to the user in a dashboard when the Elastic stack is used</summary><br><b>

The process may vary based on the chosen architecture and the processing you may want to apply to the logs. One possible workflow is:

1. The data logged by the application is picked by filebeat and sent to logstash
2. Logstash process the log based on the defined filters. Once done, the output is sent to Elasticsearch
2. Elasticsearch stores the document it got and the document is indexed for quick future access
4. The user creates visualizations in Kibana which based on the indexed data
5. The user creates a dashboard which composed out of the visualization created in the previous step
</b></details>

##### Elasticsearch

<details>
<summary>What is a data node?</summary><br><b>

This is where data is stored and also where different processing takes place (e.g. when you search for a data).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a master node?</summary><br><b>

Par of a master node responsibilites:
  * Track the status of all the nodes in the cluster
  * Verify replicas are working and the data is available from every data node.
  * No hot nodes (no data node that works much harder than other nodes)

While there can be multiple master nodes in reality only of them is the elected master node.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an ingest node?</summary><br><b>

A node which responsible for parsing the data. In case you don't use logstash then this node can recieve data from beats and parse it, similarly to how it can be parsed in Logstash.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Coordinating node?</summary><br><b>

A Coordinating node responsible for routing requests out and in to the cluser (data nodes).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How data is stored in elasticsearch?</summary><br><b>

* Data is stored in an index
* The index is spread across the cluster using shards
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an Index?</summary><br><b>

Index in Elastic is in most cases compared to a whole database from the SQL/NoSQL world.<br>
You can choose to have one index to hold all the data of your app or have multiple indices where each index holds different type of your app (e.g. index for each service your app is running).

The official docs also offer a great explanation (in general, it's really good documentation, as every project should have):

"An index can be thought of as an optimized collection of documents and each document is a collection of fields, which are the key-value pairs that contain your data"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Shards</summary><br><b>

An index is split into shards and documents are hashed to a particular shard. Each shard may be on a different node in a cluster and each one of the shards is a self contained index.<br>
This allows Elasticsearch to scale to an entire cluster of servers.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an Inverted Index?</summary><br><b>

From the official docs:

"An inverted index lists every unique word that appears in any document and identifies all of the documents each word occurs in."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Document?</summary><br><b>

Continuing with the comparison to SQL/NoSQL a Document in Elastic is a row in table in the case of SQL or a document in a collection in the case of NoSQL.
As in NoSQL a Document is a JSON object which holds data on a unit in your app. What is this unit depends on the your app. If your app related to book then each document describes a book. If you are app is about shirts then each document is a shirt.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You check the health of your elasticsearch cluster and it's red. What does it mean? What can cause the status to be yellow instead of green?</summary><br><b>

Red means some data is unavailable.
Yellow can be caused by running single node cluster instead of multi-node.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? Elasticsearch indexes all data in every field and each indexed field has the same data structure for unified and quick query ability</summary><br><b>

False.
From the official docs:

"Each indexed field has a dedicated, optimized data structure. For example, text fields are stored in inverted indices, and numeric and geo fields are stored in BKD trees."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What reserved fields a document has?</summary><br><b>

  * _index
  * _id
  * _type
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Mapping</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the advantages of defining your own mapping? (or: when would you use your own mapping?)</summary><br><b>

* You can optimize fields for partial matching
* You can define custom formats of known fields (e.g. date)
* You can perform language-specific analysis
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Replicas</summary><br><b>

In a network/cloud environment where failures can be expected any time, it is very useful and highly recommended to have a failover mechanism in case a shard/node somehow goes offline or disappears for whatever reason.
To this end, Elasticsearch allows you to make one or more copies of your index’s shards into what are called replica shards, or replicas for short.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Can you explain Term Frequency & Document Frequency?</summary><br><b>

Term Frequency is how often a term appears in a given document and Document Frequency is how often a term appears in all documents. They both are used for determining the relevance of a term by calculating Term Frequency / Document Frequency.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You check "Current Phase" under "Index lifecycle management" and you see it's set to "hot". What does it mean?</summary><br><b>

"The index is actively being written to".
More about the phases [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/ilm-policy-definition.html)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What this command does? <code>curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/customer/_doc/1?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{ "name": "John Doe" }'</code></summary><br><b>

It creates customer index if it doesn't exists and adds a new document with the field name which is set to "John Dow". Also, if it's the first document it will get the ID 1.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What will happen if you run the previous command twice? What about running it 100 times?</code></summary><br><b>

1. If name value was different then it would update "name" to the new value
2. In any case, it bumps version field by one
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the Bulk API? What would you use it for?</code></summary><br><b>

Bulk API is used when you need to index multiple documents. For high number of documents it would be significantly faster to use rather than individual requests since there are less network roundtrips.
</b></details>

##### Query DSL

<details>
<summary>Explain Elasticsearch query syntax (Booleans, Fields, Ranges)</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is Relevance Score</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Query Context and Filter Context</summary><br><b>

From the official docs:

"In the query context, a query clause answers the question “How well does this document match this query clause?” Besides deciding whether or not the document matches, the query clause also calculates a relevance score in the _score meta-field."

"In a filter context, a query clause answers the question “Does this document match this query clause?” The answer is a simple Yes or No — no scores are calculated. Filter context is mostly used for filtering structured data"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe how would an architecture of production environment with large amounts of data would be different from a small-scale environment</summary><br><b>

There are several possible answers for this question. One of them is as follows:

A small-scale architecture of elastic will consist of the elastic stack as it is. This means we will have beats, logstash, elastcsearch and kibana.<br>
A production environment with large amounts of data can include some kind of buffering component (e.g. Reddis or RabbitMQ) and also security component such as Nginx.

## DNS

<details>
<summary>What is DNS? What is it used for?</summary><br><b>

DNS (Domain Name Systems) is a protocol used for converting domain names into IP addresses.<br>
As you know computer networking is done with IP addresses (layer 3 of the OSI model) but for as humans it's hard to remember IP addresses, it's much easier to remember names. This why we need something such as DNS to convert any domain name we type into an IP address. You can think on DNS as a huge phonebook or database where each corresponding name has an IP.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How DNS works?</summary><br><b>

In general the process is as follows:

  * The user types an address in the web browser (some_site.com)
  * The operating system gets a request from the browser to translate the address the user entered
  * A query created to check a local entry of the address exists in the system. In case it doesn't, the request is forwarded to the DNS resolver
  * The Resolver is a server, usually configured by your ISP when you connect to the internet, that responsible for resolving your query by contacting other DNS servers
  * The Resolver contacts the root nameserver (aka as .)
  * The root nameserver responds with the address of the relevant Top Level Domain DNS server (if your address ends with org then the org TLD)
  * The Resolver then contacts the TLD DNS and TLD DNS responds with the IP address that matches the address the user typed in the browser
  * The Resolver passes this information to the browser
  * The user is happy :D
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the resolution sequence of: www.site.com</summary><br><b>

It's resolved in this order:

1) .
2) .com
3) site.com
4) www.site.com
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What types of DNS records are there?</summary><br><b>

  * A
  * PTR
  * MX
  * AAAA
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a A record?</summary><br><b>

A (Address) Maps a host name to an IP address. When a computer has multiple adapter cards and IP addresses, it should have multiple address records.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a AAAA record?</summary><br><b>

An AAAA Record performs the same function as an A Record, but for an IPv6 Address.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a PTR record?</summary><br><b>

While an A record points a domain name to an IP address, a PTR record does the opposite and resolves the IP address to a domain name.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a MX record?</summary><br><b>
MX (Mail Exchange) Specifies a mail exchange server for the domain, which allows mail to be delivered to the correct mail servers in the domain.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Is DNS using TCP or UDP?</summary><br><b>

DNS uses UDP port 53 for resolving queries either regular or reverse. DNS uses TCP for zone transfer.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Round Robin DNS?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is DNS Record TTL? Why do we need it?</summary><br><b>

## Distributed

<details>
<summary>Explain Distributed Computing (or Distributed System)</summary><br><b>

According to Martin Kleppmann:

"Many processes running on many machines...only message-passing via an unreliable network with variable delays, and the system may suffer from partial failures, unreliable clocks, and process pauses."

Another definition: "Systems that are physically separated, but logically connected"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What can cause a system to fail?</summary><br><b>

* Network
* CPU
* Memory
* Disk
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Do you know what is "CAP theorem"? (aka as Brewer's theorem)</summary><br><b>

According to the CAP theorem, it's not possible for a distributed data store to provide more than two of the following at the same time:

* Availability: Every request receives a response (it doesn't has to be the most recent data)
* Consistency: Every request receives a response with the latest/most recent data
* Partition tolerance: Even if some the data is lost/dropped, the system keeps running

<summary>What are the problems with the following design? How to improve it?<br>
<img src="images/distributed/distributed_design_standby.png" width="500x;" height="350px;"/>
</summary><br><b>
1. The transition can take time. In other words, noticeable downtime.
2. Standby server is a waste of resources - if first application server is running then the standby does nothing

</summary><br><b>
Issues:
If load balancer dies , we lose the ability to communicate with the application.

Ways to improve:
* Add another load balancer
* Use DNS A record for both load balancers
* Use message queue
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is "Shared-Nothing" architecture?</summary><br><b>

It's an architecture in which data is and retrieved from a single, non-shared, source usually exclusively connected to one node as opposed to architectures where the request can get to one of many nodes and the data will be retrieved from one shared location (storage, memory, ...).

<details>
<summary>When uploading a video, what is more important, latency or throughput? And how to assure that?</summary><br><b>

Throughput. To have a good throughput, the upload stream should be routed to an underutilized link.

## HR

These are not DevOps related questions as you probably noticed, but since they are part of the DevOps interview process I've decided it might be good to keep them

<details>
<summary>Tell us little bit about yourself</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Tell me about your last big project/task you worked on</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What was most challenging part in the project you worked on?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How did you hear about us?</summary><br><b>

Tell them how did you hear about them :D
Relax, there is no wrong or right answer here...I think.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you describe a good leadership? What makes a good boss for you?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Tell me about a time where you didn't agree on an implementation</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you deal with a situation where key stakeholders are not around and a big decision needs to be made? </summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</summary><br><b>

Some ideas (some of them bad and should not be used):

* Senior DevOps
* Manager
* Retirement
* Your manager
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Give an example of a time when you were able to change the view of a team about a particular tool/project/technology</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Have you ever caused a service outage? (or broke a working project, tool, ...?)</summary><br><b>

If you worked in this area for more than 5 years it's hard to imagine the answer would be no. It also doesn't have to be big service outage. Maybe you merged some code that broke a project or its tests. Simply focus on what you learned from such experience.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Rank the following in order 1 to 5, where 1 is most important: salaray, benefits, career, team/people, work life balance</summary><br><b>

You know best your order just have a good thought if you really want to put salary in top or bottom....
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You have three important tasks scheduled for today. One is for your boss, second for a colleague who is also a friend, third is for a customer. All tasks are equally important. What do you do first?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You have a colleague you don‘t get along with. Tell us some strategies how you create a good work relationship with them anyway.</summary><br><b>

Bad answer: I don't.
Better answer: Every person has strengths and weaknesses. This is true also for colleagues I don't have good work relationship with and this is what helps me to create good work relationship with them. If I am able to highlight or recognize their strengths I'm able to focus mainly on that when communicating with them.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What do you love about your work?</summary><br><b>

You know the best, but some ideas if you find it hard to express yourself:

* Diversity
* Complexity
* Challenging
* Communication with several different teams
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are your responsibilities in your current position?</summary><br><b>

You know the best :)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why should we hire you for the role?</summary><br><b>

You can use and elaborate on one or all of the following:

* Passion
* Motivation
* Autodidact
* Creativity (be able to support it with some actual examples)
</b></details>

</b></details>

## Questions you CAN ask

<a name="questions-you-ask"></a>

A list of questions you as a candidate can ask the interviewer during or after the interview.
These are only a suggestion, use them carefully. Not every interviewer will be able to answer these (or happy to) which should be perhaps a red flag warning for your regarding working in such place but that's really up to you.

<details>
<summary>What do you like about working here?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does the company promote personal growth?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the current level of technical debt you are dealing with?</summary><br><b>

Be careful when asking this question - all companies, regardless of size, have some level of tech debt.
Phrase the question in the light that all companies have the deal with this, but you want to see the current
pain points they are dealing with <br>

This is a great way to figure how managers deal with unplanned work, and how good they are at
setting expectations with projects.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why I should NOT join you? (or 'what you don't like about working here?')</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What was your favorite project you've worked on?</summary><br><b>

This can give you insights in some of the cool projects a company is working on, and if
you would enjoy working on projects like these. This is also a good way to see if
the managers are allowing employees to learn and grow with projects outside of the
normal work you'd do.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>If you could change one thing about your day to day, what would it be?</summary><br><b>

Similar to the tech debt question, this helps you identify any pain points with the company.
Additionally, it can be a great way to show how you'd be an asset to the team.<br>

For Example, if they mention they have problem X, and you've solved that in the past,
you can show how you'd be able to mitigate that problem.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Let's say that we agree and you hire me to this position, after X months, what do you expect that I have achieved?</summary><br><b>

Not only this will tell you what is expected from you, it will also provide big hint on the type of work you are going to do in the first months of your job.

Instead of working in "push mode", the consumers can pull tasks only when they are ready to handle them. It can be fixed by using a streaming platform like Kafka, Kinesis, etc. This platform will make sure to handle the high load/traffic and pass tasks/messages to consumers only when the ready to get them.

## Big Data

<details>
<summary>Explain what is exactly Big Data</summary><br><b>

As defined by Doug Laney:

* Volume: Extremely large volumes of data
* Velocity: Real time, batch, streams of data
* Variety: Various forms of data, structured, semi-structured and unstructured
* Veracity or Variability: Inconsistent, sometimes inaccurate, varying data
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the different formats of data</summary><br><b>

* Structured - data that has defined format and length (e.g. numbers, words)
* Semi-structured - Doesn't conform to a specific format but is self-describing (e.g. XML, SWIFT)
* Unstructured - does not follow a specific format (e.g. images, test messages)

<details>
<summary>Explain Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS)</summary><br><b>

* Distributed file system providing high aggregate bandwidth across the cluster.
* For a user it looks like a regular file system structure but behind the scenes it's distributed across multiple machines in a cluster
* Typical file size is TB and it can scale and supports millions of files
* It's fault tolerant which means it provides automatic recovery from faults
* It's best suited for running long batch operations rather than live analysis
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What do you know about HDFS architecture?</summary><br><b>

[HDFS Architecture](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html)

* Master-slave architecture
* Namenode - master, Datanodes - slaves
* Files split into blocks
* Blocks stored on datanodes
* Namenode controls all metadata
