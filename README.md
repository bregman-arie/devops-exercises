## Network

<details>
<summary>In general, what do you need in order to communicate?</summary><br><b>

  - A common language (for the two ends to understand)
  - A way to address who you want to communicate with
  - A Connection (so the content of the communication can reach the recipients)

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is TCP/IP?</summary><br><b>

A set of protocols that define how two or more devices can communicate with each other.

To learn more about TCP/IP, read [here](http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/basic-network-reference)

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Ethernet?</summary><br><b>

Ethernet simply refers to the most common type of Local Area Network (LAN) used today. A LAN—in contrast to a WAN (Wide Area Network), which spans a larger geographical area—is a connected network of computers in a small area, like your office, college campus, or even home.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a MAC address? What is it used for?</summary><br><b>

A MAC address is a unique identification number or code used to identify individual devices on the network.

Packets that are sent on the ethernet are always coming from a MAC address and sent to a MAC address. If a network adapter is receiving a packet, it is comparing the packet’s destination MAC address to the adapter’s own MAC address.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>When is this MAC address used?: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</summary><br><b>

When a device sends a packet to the broadcast MAC address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF​), it is delivered to all stations on the local network. Ethernet broadcasts are used to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses (by ARP) at the data link layer.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an IP address?</summary><br><b>

An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the subnet mask and give an example</summary><br><b>

A Subnet mask is a 32-bit number that masks an IP address and divides the IP addresses into network addresses and host addresses. Subnet Mask is made by setting network bits to all "1"s and setting host bits to all "0"s. Within a given network, out of the total usable host addresses, two are always reserved for specific purposes and cannot be allocated to any host. These are the first address, which is reserved as a network address (a.k.a network ID), and the last address used for network broadcast.

[Example](https://github.com/philemonnwanne/projects/tree/main/exercises/exe-09)

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a private IP address? In which scenarios/system designs, one should use it?</summary><br><b>
Private IP addresses are assigned to the hosts in the same network to communicate with one another. As the name "private" suggests, the devices having the private IP addresses assigned can't be reached by the devices from any external network. For example, if I am living in a hostel and I want my hostel mates to join the game server I have hosted, I will ask them to join via my server's private IP address, since the network is local to the hostel.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a public IP address? In which scenarios/system designs, one should use it?</summary><br><b>
A public IP address is a public-facing IP address. In the event that you were hosting a game server that you want your friends to join, you will give your friends your public IP address to allow their computers to identify and locate your network and server in order for the connection to take place. One time that you would not need to use a public-facing IP address is in the event that you were playing with friends who were connected to the same network as you, in that case, you would use a private IP address. In order for someone to be able to connect to your server that is located internally, you will have to set up a port forward to tell your router to allow traffic from the public domain into your network and vice versa.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the OSI model. What layers there are? What each layer is responsible for?</summary><br><b>

- Application: user end (HTTP is here)
- Presentation: establishes context between application-layer entities (Encryption is here)
- Session: establishes, manages, and terminates the connections
- Transport: transfers variable-length data sequences from a source to a destination host (TCP & UDP are here)
- Network: transfers datagrams from one network to another (IP is here)
- Data link: provides a link between two directly connected nodes (MAC is here)
- Physical: the electrical and physical spec of the data connection (Bits are here)

You can read more about the OSI model in [penguintutor.com](http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/basic-network-reference)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>For each of the following determines to which OSI layer it belongs:

  * Error correction
  * Packets routing
  * Cables and electrical signals
  * MAC address
  * IP address
  * Terminate connections
  * 3 way handshake</summary><br><b>
  * Error correction - Data link
  * Packets routing - Network
  * Cables and electrical signals - Physical
  * MAC address - Data link
  * IP address - Network
  * Terminate connections - Session
  * 3-way handshake - Transport
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What delivery schemes are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

Unicast: One-to-one communication where there is one sender and one receiver.

Broadcast: Sending a message to everyone in the network. The address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff is used for broadcasting.
           Two common protocols which use broadcast are ARP and DHCP.

Multicast: Sending a message to a group of subscribers. It can be one-to-many or many-to-many.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is CSMA/CD? Is it used in modern ethernet networks?</summary><br><b>

CSMA/CD stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection.
Its primary focus is to manage access to a shared medium/bus where only one host can transmit at a given point in time.

CSMA/CD algorithm:

1. Before sending a frame, it checks whether another host is already transmitting a frame.
2. If no one is transmitting, it starts transmitting the frame.
3. If two hosts transmit at the same time, we have a collision.
4. Both hosts stop sending the frame and they send everyone a 'jam signal' notifying everyone that a collision occurred
5. They are waiting for a random time before sending it again
6. Once each host waited for a random time, they try to send the frame again and so the cycle starts again
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the following network devices and the difference between them:

  * router
  * switch
  * hub</summary><br><b>

A router, switch, and hub are all network devices used to connect devices in a local area network (LAN). However, each device operates differently and has its specific use cases. Here is a brief description of each device and the differences between them:

1. Router: a network device that connects multiple network segments together. It operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and uses routing protocols to direct data between networks. Routers use IP addresses to identify devices and route data packets to the correct destination.
2. Switch: a network device that connects multiple devices on a LAN. It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and uses MAC addresses to identify devices and direct data packets to the correct destination. Switches allow devices on the same network to communicate with each other more efficiently and can prevent data collisions that can occur when multiple devices send data simultaneously.
3. Hub: a network device that connects multiple devices through a single cable and is used to connect multiple devices without segmenting a network. However, unlike a switch, it operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model and simply broadcasts data packets to all devices connected to it, regardless of whether the device is the intended recipient or not. This means that data collisions can occur, and the network's efficiency can suffer as a result. Hubs are generally not used in modern network setups, as switches are more efficient and provide better network performance.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a "Collision Domain"?</summary><br><b>
A collision domain is a network segment in which devices can potentially interfere with each other by attempting to transmit data at the same time. When two devices transmit data at the same time, it can cause a collision, resulting in lost or corrupted data. In a collision domain, all devices share the same bandwidth, and any device can potentially interfere with the transmission of data by other devices.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a "Broadcast Domain"?</summary><br><b>
A broadcast domain is a network segment in which all devices can communicate with each other by sending broadcast messages. A broadcast message is a message that is sent to all devices in a network rather than a specific device. In a broadcast domain, all devices can receive and process broadcast messages, regardless of whether the message was intended for them or not.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>three computers connected to a switch. How many collision domains are there? How many broadcast domains?</summary><br><b>

Three collision domains and one broadcast domain
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does a router work?</summary><br><b>

A router is a physical or virtual appliance that passes information between two or more packet-switched computer networks. A router inspects a given data packet's destination Internet Protocol address (IP address), calculates the best way for it to reach its destination, and then forwards it accordingly.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is NAT?</summary><br><b>

 Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more local IP addresses are translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to provide Internet access to the local hosts.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a proxy? How does it work? What do we need it for?</summary><br><b>

A proxy server acts as a gateway between you and the internet. It’s an intermediary server separating end users from the websites they browse.

If you’re using a proxy server, internet traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the address you requested. The request then comes back through that same proxy server (there are exceptions to this rule), and then the proxy server forwards the data received from the website to you.

Proxy servers provide varying levels of functionality, security, and privacy depending on your use case, needs, or company policy.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is TCP? How does it work? What is the 3-way handshake?</summary><br><b>

TCP 3-way handshake or three-way handshake is a process that is used in a TCP/IP network to make a connection between server and client.

A three-way handshake is primarily used to create a TCP socket connection. It works when:

- A client node sends an SYN data packet over an IP network to a server on the same or an external network. The objective of this packet is to ask/infer if the server is open for new connections.
- The target server must have open ports that can accept and initiate new connections. When the server receives the SYN packet from the client node, it responds and returns a confirmation receipt – the ACK packet or SYN/ACK packet.
- The client node receives the SYN/ACK from the server and responds with an ACK packet.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is round-trip delay or round-trip time?</summary><br><b>

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_delay): "the length of time it takes for a signal to be sent plus the length of time it takes for an acknowledgment of that signal to be received"

Bonus question: what is the RTT of LAN?
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does an SSL handshake work?</summary><br><b>
SSL handshake is a process that establishes a secure connection between a client and a server.

1. The client sends a Client Hello message to the server, which includes the client's version of the SSL/TLS protocol, a list of the cryptographic algorithms supported by the client, and a random value.
2. The server responds with a Server Hello message, which includes the server's version of the SSL/TLS protocol, a random value, and a session ID.
3. The server sends a Certificate message, which contains the server's certificate.
4. The server sends a Server Hello Done message, which indicates that the server is done sending messages for the Server Hello phase.
5. The client sends a Client Key Exchange message, which contains the client's public key.
6. The client sends a Change Cipher Spec message, which notifies the server that the client is about to send a message encrypted with the new cipher spec.
7. The client sends an Encrypted Handshake Message, which contains the pre-master secret encrypted with the server's public key.
8. The server sends a Change Cipher Spec message, which notifies the client that the server is about to send a message encrypted with the new cipher spec.
9. The server sends an Encrypted Handshake Message, which contains the pre-master secret encrypted with the client's public key.
10. The client and server can now exchange application data.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between TCP and UDP?</summary><br><b>

TCP establishes a connection between the client and the server to guarantee the order of the packages, on the other hand, UDP does not establish a connection between the client and server and doesn't handle package orders. This makes UDP more lightweight than TCP and a perfect candidate for services like streaming.

[Penguintutor.com](http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/basic-network-reference) provides a good explanation.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What TCP/IP protocols are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the "default gateway"</summary><br><b>

A default gateway serves as an access point or IP router that a networked computer uses to send information to a computer in another network or the internet.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is ARP? How does it work?</summary><br><b>

ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. When you try to ping an IP address on your local network, say 192.168.1.1, your system has to turn the IP address 192.168.1.1 into a MAC address. This involves using ARP to resolve the address, hence its name.

Systems keep an ARP look-up table where they store information about what IP addresses are associated with what MAC addresses. When trying to send a packet to an IP address, the system will first consult this table to see if it already knows the MAC address. If there is a value cached, ARP is not used.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is TTL? What does it help to prevent?</summary><br><b>

- TTL (Time to Live) is a value in an IP (Internet Protocol) packet that determines how many hops or routers a packet can travel before it is discarded. Each time a packet is forwarded by a router, the TTL value is decreased by one. When the TTL value reaches zero, the packet is dropped, and an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) message is sent back to the sender indicating that the packet has expired.
- TTL is used to prevent packets from circulating indefinitely in the network, which can cause congestion and degrade network performance.
- It also helps to prevent packets from being trapped in routing loops, where packets continuously travel between the same set of routers without ever reaching their destination.
- In addition, TTL can be used to help detect and prevent IP spoofing attacks, where an attacker attempts to impersonate another device on the network by using a false or fake IP address. By limiting the number of hops that a packet can travel, TTL can help prevent packets from being routed to destinations that are not legitimate.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is DHCP? How does it work?</summary><br><b>

It stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and allocates IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways to hosts. This is how it works:

* A host upon entering a network broadcasts a message in search of a DHCP server (DHCP DISCOVER)
* An offer message is sent back by the DHCP server as a packet containing lease time, subnet mask, IP addresses, etc (DHCP OFFER)
* Depending on which offer is accepted, the client sends back a reply broadcast letting all DHCP servers know (DHCP REQUEST)
* The server sends an acknowledgment (DHCP ACK)

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Can you have two DHCP servers on the same network? How does it work?</summary><br><b>

It is possible to have two DHCP servers on the same network, however, it is not recommended, and it is important to configure them carefully to prevent conflicts and configuration problems.
- When two DHCP servers are configured on the same network, there is a risk that both servers will assign IP addresses and other network configuration settings to the same device, which can cause conflicts and connectivity issues. Additionally, if the DHCP servers are configured with different network settings or options, devices on the network may receive conflicting or inconsistent configuration settings.
- However, in some cases, it may be necessary to have two DHCP servers on the same network, such as in large networks where one DHCP server may not be able to handle all the requests. In such cases, DHCP servers can be configured to serve different IP address ranges or different subnets, so they do not interfere with each other.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is SSL tunneling? How does it work?</summary><br><b>

- SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) tunneling is a technique used to establish a secure, encrypted connection between two endpoints over an insecure network, such as the Internet. The SSL tunnel is created by encapsulating the traffic within an SSL connection, which provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

Here's how SSL tunneling works:

1. A client initiates an SSL connection to a server, which involves a handshake process to establish the SSL session.
2. Once the SSL session is established, the client and server negotiate encryption parameters, such as the encryption algorithm and key length, then exchange digital certificates to authenticate each other.
3. The client then sends traffic through the SSL tunnel to the server, which decrypts the traffic and forwards it to its destination.
4. The server sends traffic back through the SSL tunnel to the client, which decrypts the traffic and forwards it to the application.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a socket? Where can you see the list of sockets in your system?</summary><br><b>

- A socket is a software endpoint that enables two-way communication between processes over a network. Sockets provide a standardized interface for network communication, allowing applications to send and receive data across a network. To view the list of open sockets on a Linux system: 
***netstat -an***
- This command displays a list of all open sockets, along with their protocol, local address, foreign address, and state.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is IPv6? Why should we consider using it if we have IPv4?</summary><br><b>

- IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the latest version of the Internet Protocol (IP), which is used to identify and communicate with devices on a network. IPv6 addresses are 128-bit addresses and are expressed in hexadecimal notation, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.

There are several reasons why we should consider using IPv6 over IPv4:

1. Address space: IPv4 has a limited address space, which has been exhausted in many parts of the world. IPv6 provides a much larger address space, allowing for trillions of unique IP addresses.
2. Security: IPv6 includes built-in support for IPsec, which provides end-to-end encryption and authentication for network traffic.
3. Performance: IPv6 includes features that can help to improve network performance, such as multicast routing, which allows a single packet to be sent to multiple destinations simultaneously.
4. Simplified network configuration: IPv6 includes features that can simplify network configuration, such as stateless autoconfiguration, which allows devices to automatically configure their own IPv6 addresses without the need for a DHCP server.
5. Better mobility support: IPv6 includes features that can improve mobility support, such as Mobile IPv6, which allows devices to maintain their IPv6 addresses as they move between different networks.

<summary>What is VLAN?</summary><br><b>

- A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a logical network that groups together a set of devices on a physical network, regardless of their physical location. VLANs are created by configuring network switches to assign a specific VLAN ID to frames sent by devices connected to a specific port or group of ports on the switch.

<details>
<summary>What is MTU?</summary><br><b>
	
MTU stands for Maximum Transmission Unit. It's the size of the largest PDU (protocol Data Unit) that can be sent in a single transaction.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if you send a packet that is bigger than the MTU?</summary><br><b>
	
With the IPv4 protocol, the router can fragment the PDU and then send all the fragmented PDU through the transaction.
	
With IPv6 protocol, it issues an error to the user's computer.

<summary>True or False? Ping is using UDP because it doesn't care about reliable connection</summary><br><b>

False. Ping is actually using ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) which is a network protocol used to send diagnostic messages and control messages related to network communication.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is SDN?</summary><br><b>

- SDN stands for Software-Defined Networking. It is an approach to network management that emphasizes the centralization of network control, enabling administrators to manage network behavior through a software abstraction.
- In a traditional network, network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls are configured and managed individually, using specialized software or command-line interfaces. In contrast, SDN separates the network control plane from the data plane, allowing administrators to manage network behavior through a centralized software controller.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is ICMP? What is it used for?</summary><br><b>

- ICMP stands for Internet Control Message Protocol. It is a protocol used for diagnostic and control purposes in IP networks. It is a part of the Internet Protocol suite, operating at the network layer.

ICMP messages are used for a variety of purposes, including:
1. Error reporting: ICMP messages are used to report errors that occur in the network, such as a packet that could not be delivered to its destination.
2. Ping: ICMP is used to send ping messages, which are used to test whether a host or network is reachable and to measure the round-trip time for packets.
3. Path MTU discovery: ICMP is used to discover the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of a path, which is the largest packet size that can be transmitted without fragmentation.
4. Traceroute: ICMP is used by the traceroute utility to trace the path that packets take through the network.
5. Router discovery: ICMP is used to discover the routers in a network.

<details>
<summary>What is NAT? How does it work?</summary><br><b>

NAT stands for Network Address Translation. It’s a way to map multiple local private addresses to a public one before transferring the information. Organizations that want multiple devices to employ a single IP address use NAT, as do most home routers.
For example, your computer's private IP could be 192.168.1.100, but your router maps the traffic to its public IP (e.g. 1.1.1.1). Any device on the internet would see the traffic coming from your public IP (1.1.1.1) instead of your private IP (192.168.1.100).

<summary>Which factors affect network performance?</summary><br><b>

Several factors can affect network performance, including:

1. Bandwidth: The available bandwidth of a network connection can significantly impact its performance. Networks with limited bandwidth can experience slow data transfer rates, high latency, and poor responsiveness.
2. Latency: Latency refers to the delay that occurs when data is transmitted from one point in a network to another. High latency can result in slow network performance, especially for real-time applications like video conferencing and online gaming.
3. Network congestion: When too many devices are using a network at the same time, network congestion can occur, leading to slow data transfer rates and poor network performance.
4. Packet loss: Packet loss occurs when packets of data are dropped during transmission. This can result in slower network speeds and lower overall network performance.
5. Network topology: The physical layout of a network, including the placement of switches, routers, and other network devices, can impact network performance.
6. Network protocol: Different network protocols have different performance characteristics, which can impact network performance. For example, TCP is a reliable protocol that can guarantee the delivery of data, but it can also result in slower performance due to the overhead required for error checking and retransmission.
7. Network security: Security measures such as firewalls and encryption can impact network performance, especially if they require significant processing power or introduce additional latency.
8. Distance: The physical distance between devices on a network can impact network performance, especially for wireless networks where signal strength and interference can affect connectivity and data transfer rates.

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a routing protocol that can be implemented on various types of routers. In general, OSPF is supported on most modern routers, including those from vendors such as Cisco, Juniper, and Huawei. The protocol is designed to work with IP-based networks, including both IPv4 and IPv6. Also, it uses a hierarchical network design, where routers are grouped into areas, with each area having its own topology map and routing table. This design helps to reduce the amount of routing information that needs to be exchanged between routers and improve network scalability.

The OSPF 4 Types of routers are:
  * Internal Router
  * Area Border Routers
  * Autonomous Systems Boundary Routers
  * Backbone Routers

### Operating System - Self Assessment

<details>
<summary>What is an operating system?</summary><br><b>

From the book "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces":

"responsible for making it easy to run programs (even allowing you to seemingly run many at the same time), allowing programs to share memory, enabling programs to interact with devices, and other fun stuff like that".
</b></details>

#### Operating System - Process

<details>
<summary>Can you explain what is a process?</summary><br><b>

A process is a running program. A program is one or more instructions and the program (or process) is executed by the operating system.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>If you had to design an API for processes in an operating system, what would this API look like?</summary><br><b>

It would support the following:

* Create - allow to create new processes
* Delete - allow to remove/destroy processes
* State - allow to check the state of the process, whether it's running, stopped, waiting, etc.
* Stop - allow to stop a running process
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How a process is created?</summary><br><b>

* The OS is reading program's code and any additional relevant data
* Program's code is loaded into the memory or more specifically, into the address space of the process.
* Memory is allocated for program's stack (aka run-time stack). The stack also initialized by the OS with data like argv, argc and parameters to main()
* Memory is allocated for program's heap which is required for dynamically allocated data like the data structures linked lists and hash tables
* I/O initialization tasks are performed, like in Unix/Linux based systems where each process has 3 file descriptors (input, output and error)
* OS is running the program, starting from main()
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? The loading of the program into the memory is done eagerly (all at once)</summary><br><b>

False. It was true in the past but today's operating systems perform lazy loading which means only the relevant pieces required for the process to run are loaded first.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are different states of a process?</summary><br><b>

* Running - it's executing instructions
* Ready - it's ready to run but for different reasons it's on hold
* Blocked - it's waiting for some operation to complete. For example I/O disk request
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are some reasons for a process to become blocked?</summary><br><b>

  - I/O operations (e.g. Reading from a disk)
  - Waiting for a packet from a network
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Inter Process Communication (IPC)?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is "time sharing"?</summary><br><b>

Even when using a system with one physical CPU, it's possible to allow multiple users to work on it and run programs. This is possible with time sharing where computing resources are shared in a way it seems to the user the system has multiple CPUs but in fact it's simply one CPU shared by applying multiprogramming and multi-tasking.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is "space sharing"?</summary><br><b>

Somewhat the opposite of time sharing. While in time sharing a resource is used for a while by one entity and then the same resource can be used by another resource, in space sharing the space is shared by multiple entities but in a way where it's not being transferred between them.<br>
It's used by one entity until this entity decides to get rid of it. Take for example storage. In storage, a file is yours until you decide to delete it.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What component determines which process runs at a given moment in time?</summary><br><b>

CPU scheduler
</b></details>

#### Operating System - Memory

<details>
<summary>What is "virtual memory" and what purpose it serves?</summary><br><b>

Virtual memory combines your computer's RAM with temporary space on your hard disk. When RAM runs low, virtual memory helps to move data from RAM to a space called a paging file. Moving data to paging file can free up the RAM so your computer can complete its work. In general, the more RAM your computer has, the faster the programs run.
https://www.minitool.com/lib/virtual-memory.html
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is demand paging?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is copy-on-write?</summary><br><b>
Copy-on-write (COW) is a resource management concept, with the goal to reduce unnecessary copying of information. It is a concept which is implemented for instance within the POSIX fork syscall, which creates a duplicate process of the calling process.

The idea:
1. If resources are shared between 2 or more entities (for example shared memory segments between 2 processes) the resources don't need to be copied for every entity, but rather every entity has a READ operation access permission on the shared resource. (the shared segements are marked as read-only) 
(Think of every entity having a pointer to the location of the shared resource which can be dereferenced to read its value)
2. If one entity would perform a WRITE operation on a shared resource a problem would arise since the resource also would be permanently changed for ALL other entities sharing it.
(Think of a process modifying some variables on the stack, or allocatingy some data dynamically on the heap, these changes to the shared resource would also apply for ALL other processes, this is definetly an undesirable behaviour)
3. As a solution only if a WRITE operation is about to be performed on a shared resource, this resource gets COPIED first and then the changes are applied.

<details>
<summary>What is a kernel, and what does it do?</summary><br><b>

The kernel is part of the operating system and is responsible for tasks like:

  * Allocating memory
  * Schedule processes
  * Control CPU
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? Some pieces of the code in the kernel are loaded into protected areas of the memory so applications can't overwritten them</summary><br><b>

True
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is POSIX?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is Semaphore and what its role in operating systems</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is cache? What is buffer?</summary><br><b>

Buffer: Reserved place in RAM which is used to hold data for temporary purposes
Cache: Cache is usually used when processes reading and writing to the disk to make the process faster by making similar data used by different programs easily accessible.
</b></details>

## Virtualization

<details>
<summary>What is Virtualization?</summary><br><b>

Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer—processors, memory, storage and more - to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a hypervisor?</summary><br><b>

Red Hat: "A hypervisor is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor, sometimes called a virtual machine monitor (VMM), isolates the hypervisor operating system and resources from the virtual machines and enables the creation and management of those VMs."

Read more [here](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-a-hypervisor)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What types of hypervisors are there?</summary><br><b>

Hosted hypervisors and bare-metal hypervisors.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the advantages and disadvantges of bare-metal hypervisor over a hosted hypervisor?</summary><br><b>

Due to having its own drivers and a direct access to hardware components, a baremetal hypervisor will often have better performances along with stability and scalability.

On the other hand, there will probably be some limitation regarding loading (any) drivers so a hosted hypervisor will usually benefit from having a better hardware compatibility.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What types of virtualization are there?</summary><br><b>

Operating system virtualization
Network functions virtualization
Desktop virtualization
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Is containerization is a type of Virtualization?</summary><br><b>

Yes, it's a operating-system-level virtualization, where the kernel is shared and allows to use multiple isolated user-spaces instances.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How the introduction of virtual machines changed the industry and the way applications were deployed?</summary><br><b>

The introduction of virtual machines allowed companies to deploy multiple business applications on the same hardware while each application is separated from each other in secured way, where each is running on its own separate operating system.
</b></details>

#### Virtual Machines

<details>
<summary>Do we need virtual machines in the age of containers? Are they still relevant?</summary><br><b>

Yes, virtual machines are still relevant even in the age of containers. While containers provide a lightweight and portable alternative to virtual machines, they do have certain limitations. Virtual machines still matter because they offer isolation and security, can run different operating systems, and are good for legacy apps. Containers limitations for example are sharing the host kernel.

## Go

<details>
<summary>What are some characteristics of the Go programming language?</summary><br><b>

  * Strong and static typing - the type of the variables can't be changed over time and they have to be defined at compile time
  * Simplicity
  * Fast compile times
  * Built-in concurrency
  * Garbage collected
  * Platform independent
  * Compile to standalone binary - anything you need to run your app will be compiled into one binary. Very useful for version management in run-time.

Go also has good community.

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between <code>var x int = 2</code> and <code>x := 2</code>?</summary><br><b>

The result is the same, a variable with the value 2.

With <code>var x int = 2</code> we are setting the variable type to integer while with <code>x := 2</code> we are letting Go figure out by itself the type.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? In Go we can redeclare variables and once declared we must use it.</summary>

False. We can't redeclare variables but yes, we must used declared variables.
</b></details>

In `mod1` a is link, and when we're using `a[i]`, we're changing `s1` value to.
But in `mod2`, `append` creats new slice, and we're changing only `a` value, not `s2`.

## Mongo

<details>
<summary>What are the advantages of MongoDB? Or in other words, why choosing MongoDB and not other implementation of NoSQL?</summary><br><b>

MongoDB advantages are as followings:
- Schemaless
- Easy to scale-out
- No complex joins
- Structure of a single object is clear

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?</summary><br><b>

The main difference is that SQL databases are structured (data is stored in the form of
tables with rows and columns - like an excel spreadsheet table) while NoSQL is
unstructured, and the data storage can vary depending on how the NoSQL DB is set up, such
as key-value pair, document-oriented, etc.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>In what scenarios would you prefer to use NoSQL/Mongo over SQL?</summary><br><b>

  * Heterogeneous data which changes often
  * Data consistency and integrity is not top priority
  * Best if the database needs to scale rapidly
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a document? What is a collection?</summary><br><b>

  * A document is a record in MongoDB, which is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format and is the basic unit of data in MongoDB.
  * A collection is a group of related documents stored in a single database in MongoDB.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an aggregator?</summary><br><b>

  * An aggregator is a framework in MongoDB that performs operations on a set of data to return a single computed result.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is better? Embedded documents or referenced?</summary><br><b>

  * There is no definitive answer to which is better, it depends on the specific use case and requirements. Some explainations : Embedded documents provide atomic updates, while referenced documents allow for better normalization.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Have you performed data retrieval optimizations in Mongo? If not, can you think about ways to optimize a slow data retrieval?</summary><br><b>

  * Some ways to optimize data retrieval in MongoDB are: indexing, proper schema design, query optimization and database load balancing.
</b></details>

##### Queries

<details>
<summary>Explain this query: <code>db.books.find({"name": /abc/})</code></summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain this query: <code>db.books.find().sort({x:1})</code></summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between find() and find_one()?</code></summary><br><b>
	
  * `find()` returns all documents that match the query conditions.
  * find_one() returns only one document that matches the query conditions (or null if no match is found).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How can you export data from Mongo DB?</code></summary><br><b>

* mongoexport
* programming languages
</b></details>

## SQL

### SQL Exercises

|Name|Topic|Objective & Instructions|Solution|Comments|
|--------|--------|------|----|----|
| Functions vs. Comparisons | Query Improvements | [Exercise](topics/sql/improve_query.md) | [Solution](topics/sql/solutions/improve_query.md)

### SQL Self Assessment

<details>
<summary>What is SQL?</summary><br><b>

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for relational databases (like MySQL, MariaDB, ...).<br>
It's used for reading, updating, removing and creating data in a relational database.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How is SQL Different from NoSQL</summary><br><b>

The main difference is that SQL databases are structured (data is stored in the form of
tables with rows and columns - like an excel spreadsheet table) while NoSQL is
unstructured, and the data storage can vary depending on how the NoSQL DB is set up, such
as key-value pair, document-oriented, etc.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>When is it best to use SQL? NoSQL?</summary><br><b>

SQL - Best used when data integrity is crucial. SQL is typically implemented with many
businesses and areas within the finance field due to it's ACID compliance.

NoSQL - Great if you need to scale things quickly. NoSQL was designed with web applications
in mind, so it works great if you need to quickly spread the same information around to
multiple servers

Additionally, since NoSQL does not adhere to the strict table with columns and rows structure
that Relational Databases require, you can store different data types together.
</b></details>

##### Practical SQL - Basics

For these questions, we will be using the Customers and Orders tables shown below:

**Customers**

Customer_ID | Customer_Name | Items_in_cart | Cash_spent_to_Date
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
100204 | John Smith | 0 | 20.00
100205 | Jane Smith | 3 | 40.00
100206 | Bobby Frank | 1 | 100.20

**ORDERS**

Customer_ID | Order_ID | Item | Price | Date_sold
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
100206 | A123 | Rubber Ducky | 2.20 | 2019-09-18
100206 | A123 | Bubble Bath | 8.00 | 2019-09-18
100206 | Q987 | 80-Pack TP | 90.00 | 2019-09-20
100205 | Z001 | Cat Food - Tuna Fish | 10.00 | 2019-08-05
100205 | Z001 | Cat Food - Chicken | 10.00 | 2019-08-05
100205 | Z001 | Cat Food - Beef | 10.00 | 2019-08-05
100205 | Z001 | Cat Food - Kitty quesadilla | 10.00 | 2019-08-05
100204 | X202 | Coffee | 20.00 | 2019-04-29

<details>
<summary>How would I select all fields from this table?</summary><br><b>

Select * <br>
From Customers;
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How many items are in John's cart?</summary><br><b>

Select Items_in_cart <br>
From Customers <br>
Where Customer_Name = "John Smith";
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the sum of all the cash spent across all customers?</summary><br><b>

Select SUM(Cash_spent_to_Date) as SUM_CASH <br>
From Customers;
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How many people have items in their cart?</summary><br><b>

Select count(1) as Number_of_People_w_items <br>
From Customers <br>
where Items_in_cart > 0;
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you join the customer table to the order table?</summary><br><b>

You would join them on the unique key. In this case, the unique key is Customer_ID in
both the Customers table and Orders table
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you show which customer ordered which items?</summary><br><b>

Select c.Customer_Name, o.Item <br>
From Customers c <br>
Left Join Orders o <br>
  On c.Customer_ID = o.Customer_ID;

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Using a with statement, how would you show who ordered cat food, and the total amount of money spent?</summary><br><b>

with cat_food as ( <br>
Select Customer_ID, SUM(Price) as TOTAL_PRICE <br>
From Orders <br>
Where Item like "%Cat Food%" <br>
Group by Customer_ID <br>
) <br>
Select Customer_name, TOTAL_PRICE <br>
From Customers c <br>
Inner JOIN cat_food f <br>
  ON c.Customer_ID = f.Customer_ID <br>
where c.Customer_ID in (Select Customer_ID from cat_food);

Although this was a simple statement, the "with" clause really shines when
a complex query needs to be run on a table before joining to another. With statements are nice,
because you create a pseudo temp when running your query, instead of creating a whole new table.

The Sum of all the purchases of cat food weren't readily available, so we used a with statement to create
the pseudo table to retrieve the sum of the prices spent by each customer, then join the table normally.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Which of the following queries would you use?

```
SELECT count(*)                             SELECT count(*)
FROM shawarma_purchases                     FROM shawarma_purchases
WHERE                               vs.     WHERE
  YEAR(purchased_at) == '2017'              purchased_at >= '2017-01-01' AND
                                            purchased_at <= '2017-31-12'
```
</summary><br><b>

```
SELECT count(*)
FROM shawarma_purchases
WHERE
  purchased_at >= '2017-01-01' AND
  purchased_at <= '2017-31-12'
```

When you use a function (`YEAR(purchased_at)`) it has to scan the whole database as opposed to using indexes and basically the column as it is, in its natural state.

<details>
<summary>Explain Puppet architecture</summary><br><b>

  * Puppet has a primary-secondary node architecture. The clients are distributed across the network and communicate with the primary-secondary environment where Puppet modules are present. The client agent sends a certificate with its ID to the server; the server then signs that certificate and sends it back to the client. This authentication allows for secure and verifiable communication between the client and the master. 
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Can you compare Puppet to other configuration management tools? Why did you chose to use Puppet?</summary><br><b>

  * Puppet is often compared to other configuration management tools like Chef, Ansible, SaltStack, and cfengine. The choice to use Puppet often depends on an organization's needs, such as ease of use, scalability, and community support.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the following:

  * Module
  * Manifest
  * Node
</summary><br><b>

  * Node - allows you to assign specific configurations to specific nodes
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Facter</summary><br><b>

  * Facter is a standalone tool in Puppet that collects information about a system and its configuration, such as the operating system, IP addresses, memory, and network interfaces. This information can be used in Puppet manifests to make decisions about how resources should be managed, and to customize the behavior of Puppet based on the characteristics of the system. Facter is integrated into Puppet, and its facts can be used within Puppet manifests to make decisions about resource management.

"Elasticsearch is a distributed document store. Instead of storing information as rows of columnar data, Elasticsearch stores complex data structures that have been serialized as JSON documents"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Logstash?</summary><br><b>
	
From the [blog](https://logit.io/blog/post/the-top-50-elk-stack-and-elasticsearch-interview-questions):

"Logstash is a powerful, flexible pipeline that collects, enriches and transports data. It works as an extract, transform & load (ETL) tool for collecting log messages."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what beats are</summary><br><b>

Beats are lightweight data shippers. These data shippers installed on the client where the data resides.
Examples of beats: Filebeat, Metricbeat, Auditbeat. There are much more.<br>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Kibana?</summary><br><b>

From the official docs:

"Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch. You use Kibana to search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices. You can easily perform advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables, and maps."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe what happens from the moment an app logged some information until it's displayed to the user in a dashboard when the Elastic stack is used</summary><br><b>

The process may vary based on the chosen architecture and the processing you may want to apply to the logs. One possible workflow is:

1. The data logged by the application is picked by filebeat and sent to logstash
2. Logstash process the log based on the defined filters. Once done, the output is sent to Elasticsearch
2. Elasticsearch stores the document it got and the document is indexed for quick future access
4. The user creates visualizations in Kibana which based on the indexed data
5. The user creates a dashboard which composed out of the visualization created in the previous step
</b></details>

##### Elasticsearch

<details>
<summary>What is a data node?</summary><br><b>

This is where data is stored and also where different processing takes place (e.g. when you search for a data).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a master node?</summary><br><b>

Part of a master node responsibilites:
  * Track the status of all the nodes in the cluster
  * Verify replicas are working and the data is available from every data node.
  * No hot nodes (no data node that works much harder than other nodes)

While there can be multiple master nodes in reality only of them is the elected master node.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an ingest node?</summary><br><b>

A node which responsible for processing the data according to ingest pipeline. In case you don't need to use 
logstash then this node can recieve data from beats and process it, similarly to how it can be processed 
in Logstash.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Coordinating only node?</summary><br><b>

From the official docs:

Coordinating only nodes can benefit large clusters by offloading the coordinating node role from data and master-eligible nodes. They join the cluster and receive the full cluster state, like every other node, and they use the cluster state to route requests directly to the appropriate place(s).

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How data is stored in Elasticsearch?</summary><br><b>

* Data is stored in an index
* The index is spread across the cluster using shards
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an Index?</summary><br><b>

Index in Elasticsearch is in most cases compared to a whole database from the SQL/NoSQL world.<br>
You can choose to have one index to hold all the data of your app or have multiple indices where each index holds different type of your app (e.g. index for each service your app is running).

The official docs also offer a great explanation (in general, it's really good documentation, as every project should have):

"An index can be thought of as an optimized collection of documents and each document is a collection of fields, which are the key-value pairs that contain your data"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Shards</summary><br><b>

An index is split into shards and documents are hashed to a particular shard. Each shard may be on a different node in a cluster and each one of the shards is a self contained index.<br>
This allows Elasticsearch to scale to an entire cluster of servers.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an Inverted Index?</summary><br><b>

From the official docs:

"An inverted index lists every unique word that appears in any document and identifies all of the documents each word occurs in."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Document?</summary><br><b>

Continuing with the comparison to SQL/NoSQL a Document in Elasticsearch is a row in table in the case of SQL or a document in a collection in the case of NoSQL.
As in NoSQL a document is a JSON object which holds data on a unit in your app. What is this unit depends on the your app. If your app related to book then each document describes a book. If you are app is about shirts then each document is a shirt.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You check the health of your elasticsearch cluster and it's red. What does it mean? What can cause the status to be yellow instead of green?</summary><br><b>

Red means some data is unavailable in your cluster. Some shards of your indices are unassinged. 
There are some other states for the cluster.
Yellow means that you have unassigned shards in the cluster. You can be in this state if you have single node and your indices have replicas.
Green means that all shards in the cluster are assigned to nodes and your cluster is healthy. 
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? Elasticsearch indexes all data in every field and each indexed field has the same data structure for unified and quick query ability</summary><br><b>

False.
From the official docs:

"Each indexed field has a dedicated, optimized data structure. For example, text fields are stored in inverted indices, and numeric and geo fields are stored in BKD trees."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What reserved fields a document has?</summary><br><b>

  * _index
  * _id
  * _type
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Mapping</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the advantages of defining your own mapping? (or: when would you use your own mapping?)</summary><br><b>

* You can optimize fields for partial matching
* You can define custom formats of known fields (e.g. date)
* You can perform language-specific analysis
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Replicas</summary><br><b>

In a network/cloud environment where failures can be expected any time, it is very useful and highly recommended to have a failover mechanism in case a shard/node somehow goes offline or disappears for whatever reason.
To this end, Elasticsearch allows you to make one or more copies of your index’s shards into what are called replica shards, or replicas for short.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Can you explain Term Frequency & Document Frequency?</summary><br><b>

Term Frequency is how often a term appears in a given document and Document Frequency is how often a term appears in all documents. They both are used for determining the relevance of a term by calculating Term Frequency / Document Frequency.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You check "Current Phase" under "Index lifecycle management" and you see it's set to "hot". What does it mean?</summary><br><b>

"The index is actively being written to".
More about the phases [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/ilm-policy-definition.html)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What this command does? <code>curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/customer/_doc/1?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{ "name": "John Doe" }'</code></summary><br><b>

It creates customer index if it doesn't exists and adds a new document with the field name which is set to "John Dow". Also, if it's the first document it will get the ID 1.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What will happen if you run the previous command twice? What about running it 100 times?</code></summary><br><b>

1. If name value was different then it would update "name" to the new value
2. In any case, it bumps version field by one
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the Bulk API? What would you use it for?</code></summary><br><b>

Bulk API is used when you need to index multiple documents. For high number of documents it would be significantly faster to use rather than individual requests since there are less network roundtrips.
</b></details>

##### Query DSL

<details>
<summary>Explain Elasticsearch query syntax (Booleans, Fields, Ranges)</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is Relevance Score</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Query Context and Filter Context</summary><br><b>

From the official docs:

"In the query context, a query clause answers the question “How well does this document match this query clause?” Besides deciding whether or not the document matches, the query clause also calculates a relevance score in the _score meta-field."

"In a filter context, a query clause answers the question “Does this document match this query clause?” The answer is a simple Yes or No — no scores are calculated. Filter context is mostly used for filtering structured data"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe how would an architecture of production environment with large amounts of data would be different from a small-scale environment</summary><br><b>

There are several possible answers for this question. One of them is as follows:

A small-scale architecture of elastic will consist of the elastic stack as it is. This means we will have beats, logstash, elastcsearch and kibana.<br>
A production environment with large amounts of data can include some kind of buffering component (e.g. Reddis or RabbitMQ) and also security component such as Nginx.
</b></details>

##### Logstash

<details>

##### Kibana

<details>
<summary>What can you find under "Discover" in Kibana?</summary><br><b>

The raw data as it is stored in the index. You can search and filter it.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You see in Kibana, after clicking on Discover, "561 hits". What does it mean?</summary><br><b>

Total number of documents matching the search results. If not query used then simply the total number of documents.
</b></details>

</b></details>

## Distributed

<details>
<summary>Explain Distributed Computing (or Distributed System)</summary><br><b>

According to Martin Kleppmann:

"Many processes running on many machines...only message-passing via an unreliable network with variable delays, and the system may suffer from partial failures, unreliable clocks, and process pauses."

Another definition: "Systems that are physically separated, but logically connected"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What can cause a system to fail?</summary><br><b>

* Network
* CPU
* Memory
* Disk
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Do you know what is "CAP theorem"? (aka as Brewer's theorem)</summary><br><b>

According to the CAP theorem, it's not possible for a distributed data store to provide more than two of the following at the same time:

* Availability: Every request receives a response (it doesn't has to be the most recent data)
* Consistency: Every request receives a response with the latest/most recent data
* Partition tolerance: Even if some the data is lost/dropped, the system keeps running

</summary><br><b>
Issues:
If load balancer dies , we lose the ability to communicate with the application.

Ways to improve:
* Add another load balancer
* Use DNS A record for both load balancers
* Use message queue
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is "Shared-Nothing" architecture?</summary><br><b>

It's an architecture in which data is and retrieved from a single, non-shared, source usually exclusively connected to one node as opposed to architectures where the request can get to one of many nodes and the data will be retrieved from one shared location (storage, memory, ...).

<summary>What happens when you type in a URL in an address bar in a browser?</summary><br><b>

1. The browser searches for the record of the domain name IP address in the DNS in the following order:
  * Browser cache
  * Operating system cache
  * The DNS server configured on the user's system (can be ISP DNS, public DNS, ...)
2. If it couldn't find a DNS record locally, a full DNS resolution is started.
3. It connects to the server using the TCP protocol
4. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server
5. The server sends an HTTP response back to the browser
6. The browser renders the response (e.g. HTML)
7. The browser then sends subsequent requests as needed to the server to get the embedded links, javascript, images in the HTML and then steps 3 to 5 are repeated.

#### API

<details>
<summary>Explain what is an API</summary><br><b>

I like this definition from [blog.christianposta.com](https://blog.christianposta.com/microservices/api-gateways-are-going-through-an-identity-crisis):

"An explicitly and purposefully defined interface designed to be invoked over a network that enables software developers to get programmatic access to data and functionality within an organization in a controlled and comfortable way."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an API specification?</summary><br><b>

From [swagger.io](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/difference-between-api-documentation-specification):

"An API specification provides a broad understanding of how an API behaves and how the API links with other APIs. It explains how the API functions and the results to expect when using the API"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? API Definition is the same as API Specification</summary><br><b>

False. From [swagger.io](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/difference-between-api-documentation-specification):

"An API definition is similar to an API specification in that it provides an understanding of how an API is organized and how the API functions. But the API definition is aimed at machine consumption instead of human consumption of APIs."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an API gateway?</summary><br><b>

An API gateway is like the gatekeeper that controls how different parts talk to each other and how information is exchanged between them.

The API gateway provides a single point of entry for all clients, and it can perform several tasks, including routing requests to the appropriate backend service, load balancing, security and authentication, rate limiting, caching, and monitoring.

By using an API gateway, organizations can simplify the management of their APIs, ensure consistent security and governance, and improve the performance and scalability of their backend services. They are also commonly used in microservices architectures, where there are many small, independent services that need to be accessed by different clients.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the advantages of using/implementing an API gateway?</summary><br><b>

Advantages:

  - Simplifies API management: Provides a single entry point for all requests, which simplifies the management and monitoring of multiple APIs.
  - Improves security: Able to implement security features like authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect the backend services from unauthorized access.
  - Enhances scalability: Can handle traffic spikes and distribute requests to backend services in a way that maximizes resource utilization and improves overall system performance.
  - Enables service composition: Can combine different backend services into a single API, providing more granular control over the services that clients can access.
  - Facilitates integration with external systems:  Can be used to expose internal services to external partners or customers, making it easier to integrate with external systems and enabling new business models.

False. It doesn't maintain state for incoming request.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How HTTP request looks like?</summary><br><b>

 * Body (not always included)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What HTTP method types are there?</summary><br><b>

* GET

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You get "504 Gateway Timeout" error from an HTTP server. What does it mean?</summary><br><b>

The server didn't receive a response from another server it communicates with in a timely manner.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a proxy?</summary><br><b>

A proxy is a server that acts as a middleman between a client device and a destination server. It can help improve privacy, security, and performance by hiding the client's IP address, filtering content, and caching frequently accessed data. 
  - Proxies can be used for load balancing, distributing traffic across multiple servers to help prevent server overload and improve website or application performance. They can also be used for data analysis, as they can log requests and traffic, providing useful insights into user behavior and preferences.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a reverse proxy?</summary><br><b>

A reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that sits between a client and a server, but it is used to manage traffic going in the opposite direction of a traditional forward proxy. In a forward proxy, the client sends requests to the proxy server, which then forwards them to the destination server. However, in a reverse proxy, the client sends requests to the destination server, but the requests are intercepted by the reverse proxy before they reach the server. 
  - They're commonly used to improve web server performance, provide high availability and fault tolerance, and enhance security by preventing direct access to the back-end server. They are often used in large-scale web applications and high-traffic websites to manage and distribute requests to multiple servers, resulting in improved scalability and reliability.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Forwarded-For): "The X-Forwarded-For (XFF) HTTP header field is a common method for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or load balancer."
</b></details>

#### Load Balancers

<details>
<summary>What is a load balancer?</summary><br><b>

A load balancer accepts (or denies) incoming network traffic from a client, and based on some criteria (application related, network, etc.) it distributes those communications out to servers (at least one).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why to used a load balancer?</summary><br><b>

* Scalability - using a load balancer, you can possibly add more servers in the backend to handle more requests/traffic from the clients, as opposed to using one server.
* Redundancy - if one server in the backend dies, the load balancer will keep forwarding the traffic/requests to the second server so users won't even notice one of the servers in the backend is down.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What load balancer techniques/algorithms are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

  * Round Robin
  * Weighted Round Robin
  * Least Connection
  * Weighted Least Connection
  * Resource Based
  * Fixed Weighting
  * Weighted Response Time
  * Source IP Hash
  * URL Hash
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the drawbacks of round robin algorithm in load balancing?</summary><br><b>

  * A simple round robin algorithm knows nothing about the load and the spec of each server it forwards the requests to. It is possible, that multiple heavy workloads requests will get to the same server while other servers will got only lightweight requests which will result in one server doing most of the work, maybe even crashing at some point because it unable to handle all the heavy workloads requests by its own.
  * Each request from the client creates a whole new session. This might be a problem for certain scenarios where you would like to perform multiple operations where the server has to know about the result of operation so basically, being sort of aware of the history it has with the client. In round robin, first request might hit server X, while second request might hit server Y and ask to continue processing the data that was processed on server X already.

<details>
<summary>What are sticky sessions? What are their pros and cons?</summary><br><b>

Recommended read:
  * [Red Hat Article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/900933)

Cons:
  * Can cause uneven load on instance (since requests routed to the same instances)
Pros:
  * Ensures in-proc sessions are not lost when a new request is created
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Name one use case for using sticky sessions</summary><br><b>

You would like to make sure the user doesn't lose the current session data.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What sticky sessions use for enabling the "stickiness"?</summary><br><b>

Cookies. There are application based cookies and duration based cookies.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain application-based cookies</summary><br><b>

* Generated by the application and/or the load balancer
* Usually allows to include custom data
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain duration-based cookies</summary><br><b>

* Generated by the load balancer
* Session is not sticky anymore once the duration elapsed
</b></details>

#### Load Balancers - Load Balancing Algorithms

<details>
<summary>Explain each of the following load balancing techniques

  * Round Robin
  * Weighted Round Robin
  * Least Connection
  * Weighted Least Connection
  * Resource Based
  * Fixed Weighting
  * Weighted Response Time
  * Source IP Hash
  * URL Hash
</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain use case for connection draining?</summary><br><b>
To ensure that a Classic Load Balancer stops sending requests to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy, while keeping the existing connections open, use connection draining. This enables the load balancer to complete in-flight requests made to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy.

The maximum timeout value can be set between 1 and 3,600 seconds on both GCP and AWS.

#### Licenses

<details>
<summary>Are you familiar with "Creative Commons"? What do you know about it?</summary><br><b>

The Creative Commons license is a set of copyright licenses that allow creators to share their work with the public while retaining some control over how it can be used. The license was developed as a response to the restrictive standards of traditional copyright laws, which limited access of creative works. Its creators to choose the terms under which their works can be shared, distributed, and used by others. They're six main types of Creative Commons licenses, each with different levels of restrictions and permissions, the six licenses are:

  * Attribution (CC BY): Allows others to distribute, remix, and build upon the work, even commercially, as long as they credit the original creator.
  * Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA): Allows others to remix and build upon the work, even commercially, as long as they credit the original creator and release any new creations under the same license.
  * Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND): Allows others to distribute the work, even commercially, but they cannot remix or change it in any way and must credit the original creator.
  * Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC): Allows others to remix and build upon the work, but they cannot use it commercially and must credit the original creator.

## Questions you CAN ask

A list of questions you as a candidate can ask the interviewer during or after the interview.
These are only a suggestion, use them carefully. Not every interviewer will be able to answer these (or happy to) which should be perhaps a red flag warning for your regarding working in such place but that's really up to you.

<details>
<summary>What do you like about working here?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does the company promote personal growth?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the current level of technical debt you are dealing with?</summary><br><b>

Be careful when asking this question - all companies, regardless of size, have some level of tech debt.
Phrase the question in the light that all companies have the deal with this, but you want to see the current
pain points they are dealing with <br>

This is a great way to figure how managers deal with unplanned work, and how good they are at
setting expectations with projects.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why I should NOT join you? (or 'what you don't like about working here?')</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What was your favorite project you've worked on?</summary><br><b>

This can give you insights in some of the cool projects a company is working on, and if
you would enjoy working on projects like these. This is also a good way to see if
the managers are allowing employees to learn and grow with projects outside of the
normal work you'd do.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>If you could change one thing about your day to day, what would it be?</summary><br><b>

Similar to the tech debt question, this helps you identify any pain points with the company.
Additionally, it can be a great way to show how you'd be an asset to the team.<br>

For Example, if they mention they have problem X, and you've solved that in the past,
you can show how you'd be able to mitigate that problem.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Let's say that we agree and you hire me to this position, after X months, what do you expect that I have achieved?</summary><br><b>

Not only this will tell you what is expected from you, it will also provide big hint on the type of work you are going to do in the first months of your job.

<details>
<summary>What is CDN?</summary><br><b>

CDN (Content Delivery Network) responsible for distributing content geographically. Part of it, is what is known as edge locations, aka cache proxies, that allows users to get their content quickly due to cache features and geographical distribution.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Multi-CDN</summary><br><b>

In single CDN, the whole content is originated from content delivery network.<br>
In multi-CDN, content is distributed across multiple different CDNs, each might be on a completely different provider/cloud.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the benefits of Multi-CDN over a single CDN?</summary><br><b>

* Resiliency: Relying on one CDN means no redundancy. With multiple CDNs you don't need to worry about your CDN being down
* Flexibility in Costs: Using one CDN enforces you to specific rates of that CDN. With multiple CDNs you can take into consideration using less expensive CDNs to deliver the content.
* Performance: With Multi-CDN there is bigger potential in choosing better locations which more close to the client asking the content
* Scale: With multiple CDNs, you can scale services to support more extreme conditions

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Disaster Recovery</summary><br><b>


Disaster recovery is the process of restoring critical business systems and data after a disruptive event. The goal is to minimize the impact and resume normal business activities quickly. This involves creating a plan, testing it, backing up critical data, and storing it in safe locations. In case of a disaster, the plan is then executed, backups are restored, and systems are hopefully brought back online. The recovery process may take hours or days depending on the damages of infrastructure. This makes business planning important, as a well-designed and tested disaster recovery plan can minimize the impact of a disaster and keep operations going.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Fault Tolerance and High Availability</summary><br><b>

Fault Tolerance - The ability to self-heal and return to normal capacity. Also the ability to withstand a failure and remain functional.

High Availability - Being able to access a resource (in some use cases, using different platforms)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between high availability and Disaster Recovery?</summary><br><b>

[wintellect.com](https://www.wintellect.com/high-availability-vs-disaster-recovery): "High availability, simply put, is eliminating single points of failure and disaster recovery is the process of getting a system back to an operational state when a system is rendered inoperative. In essence, disaster recovery picks up when high availability fails, so HA first."

<details>
<summary>Explain Vertical Scaling</summary><br><b>

Vertical Scaling is the process of adding resources to increase power of existing servers. For example, adding more CPUs, adding more RAM, etc.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the disadvantages of Vertical Scaling?</summary><br><b>

With vertical scaling alone, the component still remains a single point of failure.
In addition, it has hardware limit where if you don't have more resources, you might not be able to scale vertically.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Which type of cloud services usually support vertical scaling?</summary><br><b>

Databases, cache. It's common mostly for non-distributed systems.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Horizontal Scaling</summary><br><b>

Horizontal Scaling is the process of adding more resources that will be able handle requests as one unit
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the disadvantage of Horizontal Scaling? What is often required in order to perform Horizontal Scaling?</summary><br><b>

A load balancer. You can add more resources, but if you would like them to be part of the process, you have to serve them the requests/responses.
Also, data inconsistency is a concern with horizontal scaling.

</summary><br><b>

The load on the producers or consumers may be high which will then cause them to hang or crash.<br>
Instead of working in "push mode", the consumers can pull tasks only when they are ready to handle them. It can be fixed by using a streaming platform like Kafka, Kinesis, etc. This platform will make sure to handle the high load/traffic and pass tasks/messages to consumers only when the ready to get them.

A configuration->deployment which has some advantages like:

1. Deployment Speed - you configure once prior to deployment instead of configuring every time you deploy. This allows you to start instances/services much quicker.
2. More immutable infrastructure - with configuration->deployment it's not likely to have very different deployments since most of the configuration is done prior to the deployment. Issues like dependencies errors are handled/discovered prior to deployment in this model.

## Release

<summary>Explain Semantic Versioning</summary><br><b>

[This](https://semver.org/) page explains it perfectly:

```
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
```
