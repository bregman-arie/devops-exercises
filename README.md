## Network

<details>
<summary>What do you need in order to communicate?</summary><br><b>

  - A common language (for the two ends to understand)
  - A way to address who do you want to communicate with
  - A Connection (so the content of of the communication can reach the recipients)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is TCP/IP?</summary><br><b>

A set of protocols that define how two or more devices can communicate with each other.
To learn more about TCP/IP, read [here](http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/basic-network-reference)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Ethernet?</summary><br><b>

Ethernet simply refers to the most common type of Local Area Network (LAN) used today. A LAN—in contrast to a WAN (Wide Area Network), which spans a larger geographical area—is a connected network of computers in a small area, like your office, college campus, or even home.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a MAC address? What is it used for?</summary><br><b>

A MAC address is a unique identification number or code used to identify individual devices on the network.

Packets that are sent on the ethernet are always coming from a MAC address and sent to a MAC address. If a network adapter is receiving a packet, it is comparing the packet’s destination MAC address to the adapter’s own MAC address.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>When is this MAC address used?: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</summary><br><b>

When a device sends a packet to the broadcast MAC address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF​), it is delivered to all stations on the local network. Ethernet broadcasts are used to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses (by ARP) at the datalink layer .
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an IP address?</summary><br><b>

An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain subnet mask and given an example</summary><br><b>

A Subnet mask is a 32-bit number that masks an IP address, and divides the IP address into network address and host address. Subnet Mask is made by setting network bits to all "1"s and setting host bits to all "0"s. Within a given network, two host addresses are reserved for special purpose, and cannot be assigned to hosts. The "0" address is assigned a network address and "255" is assigned to a broadcast address, and they cannot be assigned to hosts.

**For Example**

```
| Address Class | No of Network Bits | No of Host Bits | Subnet mask     | CIDR notation |
| ------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| A             | 8                  | 24              | 255.0.0.0       | /8            |
| A             | 9                  | 23              | 255.128.0.0     | /9            |
| A             | 12                 | 20              | 255.240.0.0     | /12           |
| A             | 14                 | 18              | 255.252.0.0     | /14           |
| B             | 16                 | 16              | 255.255.0.0     | /16           |
| B             | 17                 | 15              | 255.255.128.0   | /17           |

Unitcast: One to one communication where there is one sender and one receiver.

Broadcast: Sending a message to everyone in the network. The address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff is used for broadcasting.
           Two common protocols which use broadcast are ARP and DHCP.

Multicast: Sending a message to a group of subscribers. It can be one-to-many or many-to-many.

<summary>What is CSMA/CD? Is it used in modern ethernet networks?</summary><br><b>

CSMA/CD stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection.
Its primarily focus it to manage access to shared medium/bus where only one host can transmit at a given point of time.

CSMA/CD algorithm:

1. Before sending a frame, it checks whether another host already transmitting a frame.
2. If no one transmitting, it starts transmitting the frame.
3. If two hosts transmitted at the same time, we have a collision.
4. Both hosts stop sending the frame and they send to everyone a 'jam signal' notifying everyone that a collision occurred
5. They are waiting for a random time before sending again
6. Once each host waited for a random time, they try to send the frame again and so the

<summary>Describe the following network devices and the difference between them:

  * router
  * switch
  * hub</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does a router works?</summary><br><b>

A router is a physical or virtual appliance that passes information between two or more packet-switched computer networks. A router inspects a given data packet's destination Internet Protocol address (IP address), calculates the best way for it to reach its destination and then forwards it accordingly.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is NAT?</summary><br><b>

 Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more local IP address is translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to provide Internet access to the local hosts.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a proxy? How does it works? What do we need it for?</summary><br><b>

A proxy server acts as a gateway between you and the internet. It’s an intermediary server separating end users from the websites they browse.

If you’re using a proxy server, internet traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the address you requested. The request then comes back through that same proxy server (there are exceptions to this rule), and then the proxy server forwards the data received from the website to you.

roxy servers provide varying levels of functionality, security, and privacy depending on your use case, needs, or company policy.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is TCP? How does it works? What is the 3 way handshake?</summary><br><b>

TCP 3-way handshake or three-way handshake is a process which is used in a TCP/IP network to make a connection between server and client.

A three-way handshake is primarily used to create a TCP socket connection. It works when:

- A client node sends a SYN data packet over an IP network to a server on the same or an external network. The objective of this packet is to ask/infer if the server is open for new connections.
- The target server must have open ports that can accept and initiate new connections. When the server receives the SYN packet from the client node, it responds and returns a confirmation receipt – the ACK packet or SYN/ACK packet.
- The client node receives the SYN/ACK from the server and responds with an ACK packet.

<details>
<summary>What is round-trip delay or round-trip time?</summary><br><b>

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_delay): "the length of time it takes for a signal to be sent plus the length of time it takes for an acknowledgement of that signal to be received"

Bonus question: what is the RTT of LAN?
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does SSL handshake work?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between TCP and UDP?</summary><br><b>

TCP establishes a connection between the client and the server to guarantee the order of the packages, on the other hand, UDP does not establish a connection between client and server and doesn't handle package order. This makes UDP more lightweight than TCP and a perfect candidate for services like streaming.

[Penguintutor.com](http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/basic-network-reference) provides a good explanation.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What TCP/IP protocols are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain "default gateway"</summary><br><b>

A default gateway serves as an access point or IP router that a networked computer uses to send information to a computer in another network or the internet.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is ARP? How does it works?</summary><br><b>

ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. When you try to ping an IP address on your local network, say 192.168.1.1, your system has to turn the IP address 192.168.1.1 into a MAC address. This involves using ARP to resolve the address, hence its name.

Systems keep an ARP look-up table where they store information about what IP addresses are associated with what MAC addresses. When trying to send a packet to an IP address, the system will first consult this table to see if it already knows the MAC address. If there is a value cached, ARP is not used.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is TTL? What does it helps to prevent?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is DHCP? How does it works?</summary><br><b>

It stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, and allocates IP addresses, subnet masks and gateways to hosts. This is how it works:

* A host upon entering a network, broadcasts a message in search of a DHCP server (DHCP DISCOVER)
* An offer message is sent back by the DHCP server as a packet containing lease time, subnet mask, IP addresses, etc (DHCP OFFER)
* Depending on which offer accepted, the client sends back a reply broadcast letting all DHCP servers know (DHCP REQUEST)
* Server sends an acknowledgment (DHCP ACK)

<details>
<summary>What is ICMP? What is it used for?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is NAT? How does it work?</summary><br><b>

NAT stands for network address translation. It’s a way to map multiple local private addresses to a public one before transferring the information. Organizations that want multiple devices to employ a single IP address use NAT, as do most home routers.
For example, your computer's private IP could be 192.168.1.100, but your router maps the traffic to it's public IP (e.g. 1.1.1.1). Any device on the internet would see the traffic coming from your public IP (1.1.1.1) instead of your private IP (192.168.1.100).

<summary>What is HSTS?</summary><br><b>
HTTP Strict Transport Security is a web server directive that informs user agents and web browsers how to handle its connection through a response header sent at the very beginning and back to the browser. This forces connections over HTTPS encryption, disregarding any script's call to load any resource in that domain over HTTP.

  * rm - remove files and directories
  * cat - create, view and concatenate files
  * cp - copy files and directories
  * mkdir - create directories
  * pwd - print current working directory (= at what path the user currently located)
  * cd - change directory
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What each of the following commands does?

  * cd /
  * cd ~
  * cd
  * cd ..
  * cd .
  * cd -
</summary><br><b>

  * cd / -> change to the root directory
  * cd ~ -> change to your home directory
  * cd -> change to your home directory
  * cd .. -> change to the directory above your current i.e parent directory
  * cd . -> change to the directory you currently in
  * cd - -> change to the last visited path
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Some of the commands in the previous question can be run with the -r/-R flag. What does it do? Give an example to when you would use it</summary><br><b>

The -r (or -R in some commands) flag allows the user to run a certain command recursively. For example, listing all the files under the following tree is possible when done recursively (`ls -R`):

/dir1/
  dir2/
    file1
    file2
  dir3/
    file3

To list all the files, one can run `ls -R /dir1`
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain each field in the output of `ls -l` command</summary><br><b>
It shows a detailed list of files in a long format. From the left:

* file permissions, number of links, owner name, owner group, file size, timestamp of last modification and directory/file name
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are hidden files/directories? How to list them?</summary><br><b>

These are files directly not displayed after performing a standard ls direct listing. An example of these files are .bashrc which are used to execute some scripts. Some also store configuration about services on your host like .KUBECONFIG. The command used to list them is, `ls -a`
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What do > and < do in terms of input and output for programs?</summary><br><b>
They take in input (<) and output for a given file (>) using stdin and stdout.

`myProgram < input.txt > executionOutput.txt`
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what each of the following commands does and give an example on how to use it:

  * sed
  * grep
  * cut
  * awk
</summary><br><b>

  - sed: a stream editor. Can be used for various purposes like replacing a word in a file: `sed -i s/salad/burger/g`
  - grep: a search tool. Used to search, count or match a text in a file:
    - searching for any line that contains a word in a file: `grep 'word' file.md`
    - or displaying the total number of times a string appears in a file: `grep -c 'This is a string' file.md`
  - cut: a tool for cutting out selected portions of each line of a file:
    - syntax: `cut OPTION [FILE]`
      - cutting first two bytes from a word in a file: `cut -b 1-2 file.md`, output: `wo`
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to rename the name of a file or a directory?</summary><br><b>

Using the `mv` command.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Specify which command would you use (and how) for each of the following scenarios 

  * Remove a directory with files

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How can you check what is the path of a certain command?</summary><br><b>

  * whereis
  * which
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between these two commands? Will it result in the same output?

```
echo hello world
echo "hello world"
```
</summary><br><b>

The echo command receives two separate arguments in the first execution and in the second execution it gets one argument which is the string "hello world". The output will be the same.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain piping. How do you perform piping?</summary><br><b>

Using a pipe in Linux, allows you to send the output of one command to the input of another command. For example: `cat /etc/services | wc -l`

find . -iname "*.yaml" -exec sed -i "s/1/2/g" {} \;
```
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to check which commands you executed in the past?</summary><br><b>

history command or .bash_history file
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Running the command <code>df</code> you get "command not found". What could be wrong and how to fix it?</summary><br><b>
</b>
<p><b>
Most likely the default/generated $PATH was somehow modified or overridden thus not containing <code>/bin/</code> where df would normally go.
This issue could also happen if bash_profile or any configuration file of your interpreter was wrongly modified, causing erratics behaviours.
You would solve this by fixing your $PATH variable:

As to fix it there are several options:

1. Manually adding what you need to your $PATH <code>PATH="$PATH":/user/bin:/..etc</code>
2. You have your weird env variables backed up.
3. You would look for your distro default $PATH variable, copy paste using method #1

Note: There are many ways of getting errors like this: if bash_profile or any configuration file of your interpreter was wrongly modified; causing erratics behaviours,
permissions issues, bad compiled software (if you compiled it by yourself)... there is no answer that will be true 100% of the time.
</b>
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you schedule tasks periodically?</summary><br><b>

You can use the commands <code>cron</code> and <code>at</code>.
With cron, tasks are scheduled using the following format:

<code>*/30 * * * * bash myscript.sh</code> Executes the script every 30 minutes.

<minute> <hour> <day of month> <month> <day of week> <command to execute>

The tasks are stored in a cron file, you can write in it using <code>crontab -e</code>

Alternatively if you are using a distro with systemd it's recommended to use systemd timers.

<b>
Systemd is a daemon (System 'd', d stands for daemon).

A daemon is a program that runs in the background without direct control of the user, although the user can at any time
talk to the daemon.

systemd has many features such as user processes control/tracking, snapshot support, inhibitor locks..

If we visualize the unix/linux system in layers, systemd would fall directly after the linux kernel.<br>

#### Linux - Kernel

<details>
<summary>What is a kernel, and what does it do?</summary><br><b>

The kernel is part of the operating system and is responsible for tasks like:

  * Allocating memory
  * Schedule processes
  * Control CPU
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you find out which Kernel version your system is using?</summary><br><b>

`uname -a` command
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Linux kernel module and how do you load a new module?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain user space vs. kernel space</summary><br><b>

The operating system executes the kernel in protected memory to prevent anyone from changing (and risking it crashing). This is what is known as "Kernel space".
"User space" is where users executes their commands or applications. It's important to create this separation since we can't rely on user applications to not tamper with the kernel, causing it to crash.

Applications can access system resources and indirectly the kernel space by making what is called "system calls".
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>In what phases of kernel lifecycle, can you change its configuration?</summary><br><b>

  * Build time (when it's compiled)
  * Boot time (when it starts)
  * Runtime (once it's already running)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Where can you find kernel's configuration?</summary><br><b>

Usually it will reside in `/boot/config-<kernel version>.<os release>.<arch>`
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Where can you find the file that contains the command passed to the boot loader to run the kernel?</summary><br><b>

`/proc/cmdline`
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to list kernel's runtime parameters?</summary><br><b>

`sysctl -a`
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Will running <code>sysctl -a</code> as a regular user vs. root, produce different result?</summary><br><b>

Yes, you might notice that in most systems, when running `systctl -a` with root, you'll get more runtime parameters compared to executing the same command with a regular user.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You would like to enable IPv4 forwarding in the kernel, how would you do it?</summary><br><b>

`sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`

To make it persistent (applied after reboot for example): insert `net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1` into `/etc/sysctl.conf`

Another way to is to run `echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How <code>sysctl</code> applies the changes to kernel's runtime parameters the moment you run sysctl command?</summary><br><b>

If you `strace` the sysctl command you can see it does it by changing the file under /proc/sys/...

In the past it was done with sysctl system call, but it was deprecated at some point.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How changes to kernel runtime parameters persist? (applied even after reboot to the system for example)</summary><br><b>

There is a service called `systemd-sysctl` that takes the content of /etc/sysctl.conf and applies it. This is how changes persist, even after reboot, when they are written in /etc/sysctl.conf
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Are the changes you make to kernel parameters in a container, affects also the kernel parameters of the host on which the container runs?</summary><br><b>

No. Containers have their own /proc filesystem so any change to kernel parameters inside a container, are not affecting the host or other containers running on that host.
</b></details>

#### Linux - SSH

<details>
<summary>What is SSH? How to check if a Linux server is running SSH?</summary><br><b>

[Wikipedia Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_(Secure_Shell)): "SSH or Secure Shell is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network."

[Hostinger.com Definition](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh-tutorial-how-does-ssh-work): "SSH, or Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet."

An SSH server will have SSH daemon running. Depends on the distribution, you should be able to check whether the service is running (e.g. systemctl status sshd).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why SSH is considered better than telnet?</summary><br><b>

Telnet also allows you to connect to a remote host but as opposed to SSH where the communication is encrypted, in telnet, the data is sent in clear text, so it doesn't considered to be secured because anyone on the network can see what exactly is sent, including passwords.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is stored in <code>~/.ssh/known_hosts</code>?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You try to ssh to a server and you get "Host key verification failed". What does it mean?</summary><br><b>

It means that the key of the remote host was changed and doesn't match the one that stored on the machine (in ~/.ssh/known_hosts).

<details>
<summary>What is escaping? What escape character is used for escaping?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an exit code? What exit codes are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

An exit code (or return code) represents the code returned by a child process to its
parent process.

0 is an exit code which represents success while anything higher than 1 represents error.
Each number has different meaning, based on how the application was developed.

<details>
<summary>What is a zombie process?</summary><br><b>

A process which has finished to run but has not exited.

One reason it happens is when a parent process is programmed incorrectly. Every parent process should execute wait() to get the exit code from the child process which finished to run. But when the parent isn't checking for the child exit code, the child process can still exists although it finished to run.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to get rid of zombie processes?</summary><br><b>

You can't kill a zombie process the regular way with `kill -9` for example as it's already dead.

One way to kill zombie process is by sending SIGCHLD to the parent process telling it to terminate its child processes. This might not work if the parent process wasn't programmed properly. The invocation is `kill -s SIGCHLD [parent_pid]`

You can also try closing/terminating the parent process. This will make the zombie process a child of init (1) which does periodic cleanups and will at some point clean up the zombie process.

What is the meaning of the number 3515?
</summary><br><b>

This is the TTL. When you lookup for an address using a domain/host name, your OS is performing DNS resolution by contacting DNS name servers to get the IP address of the host/domain you are looking for.<br>
When you get a reply, this reply in cached in your OS for a certain period of time. This is period of time is also known as TTL and this is the meaning of 3515 number - it will be cached for 3515 seconds before removed from the cache and during that period of time, you'll get the value from the cache instead of asking DNS name servers for the address again.

##### Linux - Packaging

<details>
<summary>Do you have experience with packaging? (as in building packages) Can you explain how does it works?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How packages installation/removal is performed on the distribution you are using?</summary><br><b>

The answer depends on the distribution being used.

##### Linux Users and Groups

<details>
<summary>What is a "superuser" (or root user)? How is it different from regular users?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you create users? Where user information is stored?</summary><br>

Command to create users is `useradd` 

Syntax:
`useradd [options] Username`

There are 2 configuration files, which stores users information

1. `/etc/passwd` - Users information like, username, shell etc is stored in this file 

2. `/etc/shadow` - Users password is stored in encrypted format 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Which file stores information about groups?</summary><br>

`/etc/groups` file stores the group name, group ID, usernames which are in secondary group.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you change/set the password of a user?</summary><br>

`passwd <username>` is the command to set/change password of a user.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Which file stores users passwords? Is it visible for everyone?</summary><br>

`/etc/shadow` file holds the passwords of the users in encryted format. NO, it is only visble to the `root` user
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you know how to create a new user without using adduser/useradd command?</summary><br>

YES, we can create new user by manually adding an entry in the `/etc/passwd` file. 

For example, if we need to create a user called `john`. 

Step 1: Add an entry to `/etc/passwd` file, so user gets created.

`echo "john:x:2001:2001::/home/john:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd` 

Step 2: Add an entry to `/etc/group` file, because every user belong to the primary group that has same name as the username.

`echo "john:x:2001:" >> /etc/group`

Step 3: Verify if the user got created

`id john`

</details>

<details>
<summary>What information is stored in /etc/passwd? explain each field</summary><br>

`/etc/passwd` is a configuration file, which contains users information. Each entry in this file has, 7 fields,

`username:password:UID:GID:Comment:home directory:shell`

`username` - The name of the user.

`password` - This field is actually a placeholder of the password field. Due to security concerns, this field does not contain the password, just a placeholder (x) to the encrypted password stored in `/etc/shadow` file.

`UID` - User ID of the user.

`GID` - Group ID 

`Comment` - This field is to provide description about the user.

`home directory` - Abousulte path of the user's home directory. This directory gets created once the user is added.

`shell` - This field contains the absolute path of the shell that will be used by the respective user.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to add a new user to the system without providing him the ability to log-in into the system?</summary><br><b>

`adduser user_name --shell=/bin/false --no-create-home`
You can also add a user and then edit /etc/passwd.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to switch to another user? How to switch to the root user?</summary><br><b>

su command.
Use su - to switch to root
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the UID the root user? What about a regular user?</summary><br>

UID of root user is 0

Default values of UID_MIN and UID_MAX in `/etc/login.defs`
`UID_MIN` is `1000`
`UID_MAX` is `60000`

Actually, we can change this value. But UID < 1000 are reserved for system accounts.
Therefore, as per the default configuration, for regular user UID starts from `1000`. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>What can you do if you lost/forogt the root password?</summary><br><b>

Re-install the OS IS NOT the right answer :)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is /etc/skel?</summary><br>

`/etc/skel` is a directory, that contains files or directories, so when a new user is created, these files/directories created under `/etc/skel` will be copied to user's home directory.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to see a list of who logged-in to the system?</summary><br><b>

Using the `last` command.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what each of the following commands does:

  * useradd
  * usermod
  * whoami
  * id</summary><br><b>

  `useradd` - Command for creating new users 
  `usermod` - Modify the users setting
  `whoami`  - Outputs, the username that we are currently logged in
  `id`      - Prints the  
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You run <code>grep $(whoami) /etc/passwd</code> but the output is empty. What might be a possible reason for that?</summary><br><b>

The user you are using isn't defined locally but originates from services like LDAP.<br>
You can verify with: `getent passwd`
</b></details>

#### Linux Hardware

<details>

`openssl req -new -x509 -days 730 -key ca-private-key.pem -sha256 -out ca.pem`
</b></details>

#### Linux - Namespaces

<details>
<summary>What types of namespaces are there in Linux?</summary><br><b>

  - Process ID namespaces: these namespaces include independent set of process IDs
  - Mount namespaces: Isolation and control of mountpoints
  - Network namespaces: Isolates system networking resources such as routing table, interfaces, ARP table, etc.
  - UTS namespaces: Isolate host and domains
  - IPC namespaces: Isolates interprocess communications
  - User namespaces: Isolate user and group IDs
  - Time namespaces: Isolates time machine
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? In every PID (Process ID) namespace the first process assigned with the process id number 1</summary><br><b>

True. Inside the namespace it's PID 1 while to the parent namespace the PID is a different one.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? In a child PID namespace all processes are aware of parent PID namespace and processes and the parent PID namespace has no visibility of child PID namespace processes</summary><br><b>

False. The opposite is true. Parent PID namespace is aware and has visibility of processes in child PID namespace and child PID namespace has no visibility as to what is going on in the parent PID namespace.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? By default, when creating two separate network namespaces, a ping from one namespace to another will work fine</summary><br><b>

False. Network namespace has its own interfaces and routing table. There is no way (without creating a bridge for example) for one network namespace to reach another.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? With UTS namespaces, processes may appear as if they run on different hosts and domains while running on the same host</summary><br><b>

True
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? It's not possible to have a root user with ID 0 in child user namespaces</summary><br><b>

False. In every child user namespace, it's possible to have a separate root user with uid of 0.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What time namespaces are used for?</summary><br><b>

In time namespaces processes can use different system time.

#### Linux - System Calls

<details>
<summary>What is a system call? What system calls are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How a program executes a system call?</summary><br><b>

- A program executes a trap instruction. The instruction jump into the kernel while raising the privileged level to kernel space.
- Once in kernel space, it can perform any privileged operation
- Once it's finished, it calls a "return-from-trap" instruction which returns to user space while reducing back the privilege level to user space.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the fork() system call</summary><br><b>

fork() is used for creating a new process. It does so by cloning the calling process but the child process has its own PID and any memory locks, I/O operations and semaphores are not inherited.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the return value of fork()?</summary><br><b>

  - On success, the PID of the child process in parent and 0 in child process
  - On error, -1 in the parent
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Name one reason for fork() to fail</summary><br><b>

Not enough memory to create a new process
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why do we need the wait() system call?</summary><br><b>

wait() is used by a parent process to wait for the child process to finish execution.
If wait is not used by a parent process then a child process might become a zombie process.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How the kernel notifies the parent process about child process termination?</summary><br><b>

The kernel notifies the parent by sending the SIGCHLD to the parent.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How the waitpid() is different from wait()?</summary><br><b>

The waitpid() is a non-blocking version of the wait() function.<br>
It also supports using library routine (e.g. system()) to wait a child process without messing up with other children processes for which the process has not waited.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? The wait() system call won't return until the child process has run and exited</summary><br><b>

True in most cases though there are cases where wait() returns before the child exits.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the exec() system call</summary><br><b>

It transforms the current running program into another program.<br>
Given the name of an executable and some arguments, it loads the code and static data from the specified executable and overwrites its current code segment and current static code data. After initializing its memory space (like stack and heap) the OS runs the program passing any arguments as the argv of that process.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? A successful call to exec() never returns</summary><br><b>

True<br>
Since a succesful exec replace the current process, it can't return anything to the process that made the call.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What system call is used for listing files?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What system calls are used for creating a new process?</summary><br><b>

fork(), exec() and the wait() system call is also included in this workflow.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What execve() does?</summary><br><b>

Executes a program. The program is passed as a filename (or path) and must be a binary executable or a script.

<details>
<summary>Explain the pipe() system call. What does it used for?</summary><br><b>

[Unix pipe implementation](https://toroid.org/unix-pipe-implementation)

"Pipes provide a unidirectional interprocess communication channel. A pipe has a read end and a write end. Data written to the write end of a pipe can be read from the read end of the pipe.
A pipe is created using pipe(2), which returns two file descriptors, one referring to the read end of the pipe, the other referring to the write end."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What happens when you execute <code>ls -l</code>?</summary><br><b>

* Shell reads the input using getline() which reads the input file stream and stores into a buffer as a string
* The buffer is broken down into tokens and stored in an array this way: {"ls", "-l", "NULL"}
* Shell checks if an expansion is required (in case of ls *.c)

* Once the program in memory, its execution starts. First by calling readdir()

Notes:

* getline() originates in GNU C library and used to read lines from input stream and stores those lines in the buffer

<details>
<summary>What exactly the command <code>alias x=y</code> does?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why running a new program is done using the fork() and exec() system calls? why a different API wasn't developed where there is one call to run a new program?</summary><br><b>

This way provides a lot of flexibility. It allows the shell for example, to run code after the call to fork() but before the call to exec(). Such code can be used to alter the environment of the program it about to run.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe shortly what happens when you execute a command in the shell</summary><br><b>

The shell figures out, using the PATH variable, where the executable of the command resides in the filesystem. It then calls fork() to create a new child process for running the command. Once the fork was executed successfully, it calls a variant of exec() to execute the command and finally, waits the command to finish using wait(). When the child completes, the shell returns from wait() and prints out the prompt again.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What does the following block do?:

|Fork 102|Fork|[Link](exercises/os/fork_102.md)|[Link](exercises/os/solutions/fork_102_solution.md)

### Operating System - Self Assessment

<details>
<summary>What is an operating system?</summary><br><b>

From the book "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces":

"responsible for making it easy to run programs (even allowing you to seemingly run many at the same time), allowing programs to share memory, enabling programs to interact with devices, and other fun stuff like that".
</b></details>

#### Operating System - Process

<details>
<summary>Can you explain what is a process?</summary><br><b>

A process is a running program. A program is one or more instructions and the program (or process) is executed by the operating system.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>If you had to design an API for processes in an operating system, what would this API look like?</summary><br><b>

It would support the following:

* Create - allow to create new processes
* Delete - allow to remove/destroy processes
* State - allow to check the state of the process, whether it's running, stopped, waiting, etc.
* Stop - allow to stop a running process
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How a process is created?</summary><br><b>

* The OS is reading program's code and any additional relevant data
* Program's code is loaded into the memory or more specifically, into the address space of the process.
* Memory is allocated for program's stack (aka run-time stack). The stack also initialized by the OS with data like argv, argc and parameters to main()
* Memory is allocated for program's heap which is required for dynamically allocated data like the data structures linked lists and hash tables
* I/O initialization tasks are performed, like in Unix/Linux based systems where each process has 3 file descriptors (input, output and error)
* OS is running the program, starting from main()
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? The loading of the program into the memory is done eagerly (all at once)</summary><br><b>

False. It was true in the past but today's operating systems perform lazy loading which means only the relevant pieces required for the process to run are loaded first.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are different states of a process?</summary><br><b>

* Running - it's executing instructions
* Ready - it's ready to run but for different reasons it's on hold
* Blocked - it's waiting for some operation to complete. For example I/O disk request
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are some reasons for a process to become blocked?</summary><br><b>

  - I/O operations (e.g. Reading from a disk)
  - Waiting for a packet from a network
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Inter Process Communication (IPC)?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is "time sharing"?</summary><br><b>

Even when using a system with one physical CPU, it's possible to allow multiple users to work on it and run programs. This is possible with time sharing where computing resources are shared in a way it seems to the user the system has multiple CPUs but in fact it's simply one CPU shared by applying multiprogramming and multi-tasking.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is "space sharing"?</summary><br><b>

Somewhat the opposite of time sharing. While in time sharing a resource is used for a while by one entity and then the same resource can be used by another resource, in space sharing the space is shared by multiple entities but in a way where it's not being transferred between them.<br>
It's used by one entity until this entity decides to get rid of it. Take for example storage. In storage, a file is yours until you decide to delete it.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What component determines which process runs at a given moment in time?</summary><br><b>

CPU scheduler
</b></details>

#### Operating System - Memory

<details>
<summary>What is "virtual memory" and what purpose it serves?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is demand paging?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is copy-on-write or shadowing?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a kernel, and what does it do?</summary><br><b>

The kernel is part of the operating system and is responsible for tasks like:

  * Allocating memory
  * Schedule processes
  * Control CPU
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? Some pieces of the code in the kernel are loaded into protected areas of the memory so applications can't overwritten them</summary><br><b>

True
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is POSIX?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is Semaphore and what its role in operating systems</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is cache? What is buffer?</summary><br><b>

Buffer: Reserved place in RAM which is used to hold data for temporary purposes
Cache: Cache is usually used when processes reading and writing to the disk to make the process faster by making similar data used by different programs easily accessible.
</b></details>

## Virtualization

<details>
<summary>What is Virtualization?</summary><br><b>

Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer—processors, memory, storage and more - to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a hypervisor?</summary><br><b>

Red Hat: "A hypervisor is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor, sometimes called a virtual machine monitor (VMM), isolates the hypervisor operating system and resources from the virtual machines and enables the creation and management of those VMs."

Read more [here](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-a-hypervisor)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What types of hypervisors are there?</summary><br><b>

Hosted hypervisors and bare-metal hypervisors.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the advantages and disadvantges of bare-metal hypervisor over a hosted hypervisor?</summary><br><b>

Due to having its own drivers and a direct access to hardware components, a baremetal hypervisor will often have better performances along with stability and scalability.

On the other hand, there will probably be some limitation regarding loading (any) drivers so a hosted hypervisor will usually benefit from having a better hardware compatibility.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What types of virtualization are there?</summary><br><b>

Operating system virtualization
Network functions virtualization
Desktop virtualization
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Is containerization is a type of Virtualization?</summary><br><b>

Yes, it's a operating-system-level virtualization, where the kernel is shared and allows to use multiple isolated user-spaces instances.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How the introduction of virtual machines changed the industry and the way applications were deployed?</summary><br><b>

The introduction of virtual machines allowed companies to deploy multiple business applications on the same hardware while each application is separated from each other in secured way, where each is running on its own separate operating system.
</b></details>

### Python Self Assessment

<details>
<summary>What are some characteristics of the Python programming language?</summary><br><b>

```
1. It is a high level general purpose programming language created in 1991 by Guido Van Rosum.
2. The language is interpreted, being the CPython (Written in C) the most used/maintained implementation.
3. It is strongly typed. The typing discipline is duck typing and gradual.
4. Python focuses on readability and makes use of whitespaces/identation instead of brackets { }
5. The python package manager is called PIP "pip installs packages", having more than 200.000 available packages.
6. Python comes with pip installed and a big standard library that offers the programmer many precooked solutions.
7. In python **Everything** is an object.

Mutability determines whether you can modify an object of specific type.

The mutable data types are:

    List
    Dictionary
    Set

The immutable data types are:

    Numbers (int, float, ...)
    String
    Bool
    Tuple
    Frozenset

bool("  ") -> evaluates to True
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the result of running <code>[] is not []</code>? explain the result</summary><br><b>

It evaluates to True.<br>

#### Python - Functions

<details>
<summary>How to define a function with Python?</summary><br><b>
Using the `def` keyword. For Examples:

```
def sum(a, b):
    return (a + b)
```
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>In Python, functions are first-class objects. What does it mean?</summary><br><b>

In general, first class objects in programming languages are objects which can be assigned to variable, used as a return value and can be used as arguments or parameters.<br>
In python you can treat functions this way. Let's say we have the following function

```
def my_function():
    return 5
```

You can then assign a function to a variables like this `x = my_function` or you can return functions as return values like this `return my_function`
</b></details>

#### Python - Integer

<details>
<summary>Write a function to determine if a number is a Palindrome</summary><br><b>

- Code:

```
from typing import Union

def isNumberPalindrome(number: Union[int, str]) -> bool:
    if isinstance(number, int):
        number = str(number)
    return number == number[::-1]

print(isNumberPalindrome("12321"))
```

- Using Python3.10 that accepts using bitwise operator '|'. 

```
def isNumberPalindrome(number: int | str) -> bool:
    if isinstance(number, int):
        number = str(number)
    return number == number[::-1]

print(isNumberPalindrome("12321"))
```

Note: Using slicing to reverse a list could be slower than other options like `reversed` that return an iterator.

- Result:

```
True
```

<summary>What is the result of the following block of code?

```
x = ['a', 'b', 'c']

    print(i)
```
</summary><br><b>

```
a
b
c
```
</b></details>

#### Python - OOP

<details>
<summary>Explain inheritance and how to use it in Python</summary><br><b>

```
By definition inheritance is the mechanism where an object acts as a base of another object, retaining all its
properties.

So if Class B inherits from Class A, every characteristics from class A will be also available in class B.
Class A would be the 'Base class' and B class would be the 'derived class'.

This comes handy when you have several classes that share the same functionalities.

The basic syntax is:

class Base: pass

class Derived(Base): pass

A more forged example:

class Animal:
    def __init__(self):
        print("and I'm alive!")

    def eat(self, food):
        print("ñom ñom ñom", food)

class Human(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        print('My name is ', name)
        super().__init__()

    def write_poem(self):
        print('Foo bar bar foo foo bar!')

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        print('My name is', name)
        super().__init__()

    def bark(self):
        print('woof woof')


michael = Human('Michael')
michael.eat('Spam')
michael.write_poem()

bruno = Dog('Bruno')
bruno.eat('bone')
bruno.bark()

>>> My name is  Michael
>>> and I'm alive!
>>> ñom ñom ñom Spam
>>> Foo bar bar foo foo bar!
>>> My name is Bruno
>>> and I'm alive!
>>> ñom ñom ñom bone
>>> woof woof

Calling super() calls the Base method, thus, calling super().__init__() we called the Animal __init__.

There is a more advanced python feature called MetaClasses that aid the programmer to directly control class creation.
```

<details>
<summary>Explain and demonstrate class attributes & instance attributes</summary><br><b>

In the following block of code `x` is a class attribute while `self.y` is a instance attribute

```
class MyClass(object):
    x = 1

    def __init__(self, y):
        self.y = y
```

#### Python - Exceptions

<details>
<summary>What is an error? What is an exception? What types of exceptions are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

```
#  Note that you generally don't need to know the compiling process but knowing where everything comes from
#  and giving complete answers shows that you truly know what you are talking about.

Generally, every compiling process have a two steps.
    - Analysis
    - Code Generation.

    Analysis can be broken into:
        1. Lexical analysis   (Tokenizes source code)
        2. Syntactic analysis (Check whether the tokens are legal or not, tldr, if syntax is correct)

               for i in 'foo'

        3. Semantic analysis  (Contextual analysis, legal syntax can still trigger errors, did you try to divide by 0,
          hash a mutable object or use an undeclared function?)

                 1/0
                ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

    These three analysis steps are the responsible for error handlings.

    The second step would be responsible for errors, mostly syntax errors, the most common error.
    The third step would be responsible for Exceptions.

    As we have seen, Exceptions are semantic errors, there are many builtin Exceptions:

        ImportError
        ValueError
        KeyError
        FileNotFoundError
        IndentationError
        IndexError
        ...

    You can also have user defined Exceptions that have to inherit from the `Exception` class, directly or indirectly.

    Basic example:

    class DividedBy2Error(Exception):
        def __init__(self, message):
            self.message = message


    def division(dividend,divisor):
        if divisor == 2:
            raise DividedBy2Error('I dont want you to divide by 2!')
        return dividend / divisor

    division(100, 2)

    >>> __main__.DividedBy2Error: I dont want you to divide by 2!
```

<summary>Explain Exception Handling and how to use it in Python</summary><br><b>

**Exceptions:** Errors detected during execution are called Exceptions.

**Handling Exception:** When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message.</br>
Exceptions can be handled using `try` and `except` statement in python.

**Example:** Following example asks the user for input until a valid integer has been entered. </br>
If user enter a non-integer value it will raise exception and using except it will catch that exception and ask the user to enter valid integer again.


```py
while True:
    try:
        a = int(input("please enter an integer value: "))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Ops! Please enter a valid integer value.")

```

For more details about errors and exceptions follow this [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)

#### Python Built-in functions

<details>
<summary>Explain the following built-in functions (their purpose + use case example):

  * repr
  * any
  * all</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between repr function and str?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the __call__ method?</summary><br><b>

It is used to emulate callable objects. It allows a class instance to be called as a function.

- Example code:

```
class Foo:
    def __init__(self: object) ->  None:
        pass
    def __call__(self: object) -> None:
        print("Called!")

f = Foo()
f()
```

- Result:

```
Called!
```

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Do classes has the __call__ method as well? What for?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What _ is used for in Python?</summary><br><b>

1. Translation lookup in i18n
2. Hold the result of the last executed expression or statement in the interactive interpreter.
3. As a general purpose "throwaway" variable name. For example: x, y, _ = get_data() (x and y are used but since we don't care about third variable, we "threw it away").
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is GIL</summary><br><b>
	Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a type of process lock which is used by python whenever it deals with processes. Generally, Python only uses only one thread to execute the set of written statements. This means that in python only one thread will be executed at a time
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Lambda? How is it used?</summary><br><b>

A <code>lambda</code> expression is an 'anonymous' function, the difference from a normal defined function using the keyword `def`` is the syntax and usage.

The syntax is:

```lambda[parameters]: [expresion]```

**Examples:**

* A lambda function add 10 with any argument passed.

```py
x = lambda a: a + 10
print(x(10))
```

* An addition function

```py
addition = lambda x, y: x + y
print(addition(10, 20))
```

* Squaring function

```py
square = lambda x : x ** 2
print(square(5))
```
Generally it is considered a bad practice under PEP 8 to assign a lambda expresion, they are meant to be used as parameters and inside of other defined functions.

```
def return_sum():

#### Python - Lists

<details>
<summary>What is a tuple in Python? What is it used for?</summary><br><b>

A tuple is a built-in data type in Python. It's used for storing multiple items in a single variable.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>List, like a tuple, is also used for storing multiple items. What is then, the difference between a tuple and a list?</summary><br><b>

List, as opposed to a tuple, is a mutable data type. It means we can modify it and at items to it.

numbers.insert(0, 0)
print(numbers)
```

- Multiple items or list:

```
numbers_1 = [2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers_2 = [0, 1]
numbers_1 = numbers_2 + numbers_1
print(numbers_1)
```

</b></details>

<summary>How to check if all the elements in a given lists are unique? so [1, 2, 3] is unique but [1, 1, 2, 3] is not unique because 1 exists twice</summary><br><b>
</b>

There are many ways of solving this problem:<br>
<code># Note: :list and -> bool are just python typings, they are not needed for the correct execution of the algorithm. </code>

Taking advantage of sets and len:

```
def is_unique(l:list) -> bool:
    return len(set(l)) == len(l)
```

This one is can be seen used in other programming languages.

```
def is_unique2(l:list) -> bool:
    seen = []

    for i in l:
        if i in seen:
            return False
        seen.append(i)
    return True
```

Here we just count and make sure every element is just repeated once.

```
def is_unique3(l:list) -> bool:
    for i in l:
        if l.count(i) > 1:
            return False
    return True
```

This one might look more convulated but hey, one liners.

```
def is_unique4(l:list) -> bool:
    return all(map(lambda x: l.count(x) < 2, l))
```

<summary>What is List Comprehension? Is it better than a typical loop? Why? Can you demonstrate how to use it?</summary><br><b>

From [Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions): "List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.".

It's better because they're compact, faster and have better readability.

- For loop:

```
number_lists = [[1, 7, 3, 1], [13, 93, 23, 12], [123, 423, 456, 653, 124]]
odd_numbers = []
for number_list in number_lists:
    for number in number_list:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            odd_numbers.append(number)
print(odd_numbers)
```

- List comprehesion:

```
number_lists = [[1, 7, 3, 1], [13, 93, 23, 12], [123, 423, 456, 653, 124]]
odd_numbers = [number for number_list in number_lists for number in number_list if number % 2 == 0]

<summary>What empty <code>return</code> returns?</summary><br><b>
</b>

Short answer is: It returns a None object.

We could go a bit deeper and explain the difference between

```
def a ():
    return

>>> None
```

And

```
def a ():
    pass

>>> None
```
Or we could be asked this as a following question, since they both give the same result.

We could use the dis module to see what's going on:

```
  2           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (<code object a at 0x0000029C4D3C2DB0, file "<dis>", line 2>)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 ('a')
              4 MAKE_FUNCTION            0
              6 STORE_NAME               0 (a)

  5           8 LOAD_CONST               2 (<code object b at 0x0000029C4D3C2ED0, file "<dis>", line 5>)
             10 LOAD_CONST               3 ('b')
             12 MAKE_FUNCTION            0
             14 STORE_NAME               1 (b)
             16 LOAD_CONST               4 (None)
             18 RETURN_VALUE

Disassembly of <code object a at 0x0000029C4D3C2DB0, file "<dis>", line 2>:
  3           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
              2 RETURN_VALUE

Disassembly of <code object b at 0x0000029C4D3C2ED0, file "<dis>", line 5>:
  6           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
              2 RETURN_VALUE
```

An empty <code> return</code> is exactly the same as <code>return None</code> and functions without any explicit return
will always return None regardless of the operations, therefore


```
def sum(a, b):
    global c
    c = a + b

>>> None
```

#### Python - Linked List

<details>
<summary>Can you implement a linked list in Python?</summary><br><b>

The reason we need to implement in the first place, it's because a linked list isn't part of Python standard library.<br>
To implement a linked list, we have to implement two structures: The linked list itself and a node which is used by the linked list.

Let's start with a node. A node has some value (the data it holds) and a pointer to the next node

```
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

Now the linked list. An empty linked list has nothing but an empty head.

```
class LinkedList(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```

Now we can start using the linked list

```
ll = Linkedlist()
ll.head = Node(1)
ll.head.next = Node(2)
ll.head.next.next = Node(3)
```

What we have is:

----       -----      ----
| 1 | ->   | 2 |  ->  | 3 |
----       -----      -----

Usually, more methods are implemented, like a push_head() method where you insert a node at the beginning of the linked list

```
def push_head(self, value):
    new_node = Node(value)
    new_node.next = self.head
    self.head = new_node
```
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Add a method to the Linked List class to traverse (print every node's data) the linked list</summary><br><b>

def print_list(self):
    node = self.head
    while(node):
        print(node.data)
        node = node.next
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Write a method to that will return a boolean based on whether there is a loop in a linked list or not</summary><br><b>

Let's use the Floyd's Cycle-Finding algorithm:

```
def loop_exists(self):
    one_step_p = self.head
    two_steps_p = self.head
    while(one_step_p and two_steps_p and two_steps_p.next):
        one_step_p = self.head.next
        two_step_p = self.head.next.next
        if (one_step_p == two_steps_p):
            return True 
    return False
```

```
@app.route('/')
def home():
  return 'main website'
```

- `add_url_rule` method: This is a method of the Flask class. We can also use it for map the URL with a function.

```
def home():
  return 'main website'

app.add_url_rule('/', view_func=home)

<summary>Explain what is a decorator</summary><br><b>
</b>
<b>In python, everything is an object, even functions themselves. Therefore you could pass functions as arguments
for another function eg;

```
def wee(word):
    return word

def oh(f):
    return f + "Ohh"

>>> oh(wee("Wee"))
<<< Wee Ohh
```

This allows us to control the before execution of any given function and if we added another function as wrapper,
(a function receiving another function that receives a function as parameter) we could also control the after execution.

Sometimes we want to control the before-after execution of many functions and it would get tedious to write

<code> f = function(function_1())</code>
<code> f = function(function_1(function_2(*args)))</code>

every time, that's what decorators do, they introduce syntax to write all of this on the go, using the keyword '@'.
</b>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can you show how to write and use decorators?</summary><br><b>

<code>
These two decorators (ntimes and timer) are usually used to display decorators functionalities, you can find them in lots of
tutorials/reviews. I first saw these examples two years ago in pyData 2017. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lmCu8wz8ro&t=3731s</code>

```
Simple decorator:

def deco(f):
    print(f"Hi I am the {f.__name__}() function!")
    return f

@deco
def hello_world():
    return "Hi, I'm in!"

a = hello_world()
print(a)

>>> Hi I am the hello_world() function!
    Hi, I'm in!
```

This is the simplest decorator version, it basically saves us from writting <code>a = deco(hello_world())</code>.
But at this point we can only control the before execution, let's take on the after:

```
def deco(f):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Rick Sanchez!")
        func = f(*args, **kwargs)
        print("I'm in!")
        return func
    return wrapper

@deco
def f(word):
    print(word)

a = f("************")
>>> Rick Sanchez!
    ************
    I'm in!
```

deco receives a function -> f
wrapper receives the arguments -> *args, **kwargs

wrapper returns the function plus the arguments -> f(*args, **kwargs)
deco returns wrapper.

As you can see we conveniently do things before and after the execution of a given function.

For example, we could write a decorator that calculates the execution time of a function.

```
import time
def deco(f):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        before = time.time()
        func = f(*args, **kwargs)
        after = time.time()
        print(after-before)
        return func
    return wrapper

@deco
def f():
    time.sleep(2)
    print("************")

a = f()
>>> 2.0008859634399414
```

Or create a decorator that executes a function n times.

```
def n_times(n):
    def wrapper(f):
        def inner(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(n):
                func = f(*args, **kwargs)
            return func
        return inner
    return wrapper

@n_times(4)
def f():
    print("************")

a = f()

>>>************
   ************
   ************
   ************

## Mongo

<details>
<summary>What are the advantages of MongoDB? Or in other words, why choosing MongoDB and not other implementation of NoSQL?</summary><br><b>

MongoDB advantages are as followings:
- Schemaless
- Easy to scale-out
- No complex joins
- Structure of a single object is clear

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?</summary><br><b>

The main difference is that SQL databases are structured (data is stored in the form of
tables with rows and columns - like an excel spreadsheet table) while NoSQL is
unstructured, and the data storage can vary depending on how the NoSQL DB is set up, such
as key-value pair, document-oriented, etc.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>In what scenarios would you prefer to use NoSQL/Mongo over SQL?</summary><br><b>

  * Heterogeneous data which changes often
  * Data consistency and integrity is not top priority
  * Best if the database needs to scale rapidly

### SQL Self Assessment

<details>
<summary>What is SQL?</summary><br><b>

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for relational databases (like MySQL, MariaDB, ...).<br>
It's used for reading, updating, removing and creating data in a relational database.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How is SQL Different from NoSQL</summary><br><b>

The main difference is that SQL databases are structured (data is stored in the form of
tables with rows and columns - like an excel spreadsheet table) while NoSQL is
unstructured, and the data storage can vary depending on how the NoSQL DB is set up, such
as key-value pair, document-oriented, etc.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>When is it best to use SQL? NoSQL?</summary><br><b>

SQL - Best used when data integrity is crucial. SQL is typically implemented with many
businesses and areas within the finance field due to it's ACID compliance.

NoSQL - Great if you need to scale things quickly. NoSQL was designed with web applications
in mind, so it works great if you need to quickly spread the same information around to
multiple servers

Additionally, since NoSQL does not adhere to the strict table with columns and rows structure
that Relational Databases require, you can store different data types together.
</b></details>

##### Practical SQL - Basics

For these questions, we will be using the Customers and Orders tables shown below:

**Customers**

Customer_ID | Customer_Name | Items_in_cart | Cash_spent_to_Date
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
100204 | John Smith | 0 | 20.00
100205 | Jane Smith | 3 | 40.00
100206 | Bobby Frank | 1 | 100.20

**ORDERS**

Customer_ID | Order_ID | Item | Price | Date_sold
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
100206 | A123 | Rubber Ducky | 2.20 | 2019-09-18
100206 | A123 | Bubble Bath | 8.00 | 2019-09-18
100206 | Q987 | 80-Pack TP | 90.00 | 2019-09-20
100205 | Z001 | Cat Food - Tuna Fish | 10.00 | 2019-08-05
100205 | Z001 | Cat Food - Chicken | 10.00 | 2019-08-05
100205 | Z001 | Cat Food - Beef | 10.00 | 2019-08-05
100205 | Z001 | Cat Food - Kitty quesadilla | 10.00 | 2019-08-05
100204 | X202 | Coffee | 20.00 | 2019-04-29

<details>
<summary>How would I select all fields from this table?</summary><br><b>

Select * <br>
From Customers;
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How many items are in John's cart?</summary><br><b>

Select Items_in_cart <br>
From Customers <br>
Where Customer_Name = "John Smith";
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the sum of all the cash spent across all customers?</summary><br><b>

Select SUM(Cash_spent_to_Date) as SUM_CASH <br>
From Customers;
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How many people have items in their cart?</summary><br><b>

Select count(1) as Number_of_People_w_items <br>
From Customers <br>
where Items_in_cart > 0;
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you join the customer table to the order table?</summary><br><b>

You would join them on the unique key. In this case, the unique key is Customer_ID in
both the Customers table and Orders table
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you show which customer ordered which items?</summary><br><b>

Select c.Customer_Name, o.Item <br>
From Customers c <br>
Left Join Orders o <br>
  On c.Customer_ID = o.Customer_ID;

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Using a with statement, how would you show who ordered cat food, and the total amount of money spent?</summary><br><b>

with cat_food as ( <br>
Select Customer_ID, SUM(Price) as TOTAL_PRICE <br>
From Orders <br>
Where Item like "%Cat Food%" <br>
Group by Customer_ID <br>
) <br>
Select Customer_name, TOTAL_PRICE <br>
From Customers c <br>
Inner JOIN cat_food f <br>
  ON c.Customer_ID = f.Customer_ID <br>
where c.Customer_ID in (Select Customer_ID from cat_food);

Although this was a simple statement, the "with" clause really shines when
a complex query needs to be run on a table before joining to another. With statements are nice,
because you create a pseudo temp when running your query, instead of creating a whole new table.

The Sum of all the purchases of cat food weren't readily available, so we used a with statement to create
the pseudo table to retrieve the sum of the prices spent by each customer, then join the table normally.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Which of the following queries would you use?

```
SELECT count(*)                             SELECT count(*)
FROM shawarma_purchases                     FROM shawarma_purchases
WHERE                               vs.     WHERE
  YEAR(purchased_at) == '2017'              purchased_at >= '2017-01-01' AND
                                            purchased_at <= '2017-31-12'
```
</summary><br><b>

```
SELECT count(*)
FROM shawarma_purchases
WHERE
  purchased_at >= '2017-01-01' AND
  purchased_at <= '2017-31-12'
```

When you use a function (`YEAR(purchased_at)`) it has to scan the whole database as opposed to using indexes and basically the column as it is, in its natural state.

### Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

<details>
<summary>What is GKE</summary><br><b>

* It is the managed kubernetes service on GCP for deploying, managing and scaling containerised applications using Google infrastructure.
</b></details>

### Anthos

<details>
<summary>What is Anthos</summary><br><b>
It is a managed application platform for organisations like enterprises that require quick modernisation and certain levels
of consistency for their legacy applications in a hybrid or multicloud world. From this explanation the core ideas can be drawn from these statements;

* Managed -> the customer does not need to worry about the underlying software intergrations, they just enable the API.
* application platform -> It consists of open source tools like K8s, Knative, Istio and Tekton
* Enterprises -> these are usually organisations with complex needs
* Consistency -> to have the same policies declaratively initiated to be run anywhere securely e.g on-prem, GCP or other-clouds (AWS or Azure)

fun fact: Anthos is flower in greek, they grow in the ground (earth) but need rain from the clouds to flourish.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>List the technical components that make up Anthos</summary><br><b>

* Infrastructure management - Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
* Cluster management - GKE, Ingress for Anthos
* Service management - Anthos Service Mesh
* Policy enforcement - Anthos Config Management, Anthos Enterprise Data Protection, Policy Controller
* Application deployment - CI/CD tools like Cloud Build, GitLab
* Application development - Cloud Code
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the primary computing environment for Anthos to easily manage workload deployment?</summary><br><b>

* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does Anthos handle the control plane and node components for GKE?</summary><br><b>

On GCP the kubernetes api-server is the only control plane component exposed to customers whilst compute engine manages
instances in the project.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Which load balancing options are available?</summary><br><b>

* Networking load balancing for L4 and HTTP(S) Load Balancing for L7 which are both managed services that do not require
  additional configuration.
* Ingress for Anthos which allows the ability to deploy a load balancer that serves an application across multiple clusters
  on GKE
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Can you deploy Anthos on AWS?</summary><br><b>

* Yes, Anthos on AWS is now GA. For more read [here](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/gke/docs/aws)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>List and explain the enterprise security capabilities provided by Anthos</summary><br><b>

* Control plane security - GCP manages and maintains the K8s control plane out of the box. The user can secure the api-server by using master authorized networks and private clusters. These allow the user to disable access on the public IP address by assigning a private IP address to the master.
* Node security - By default workloads are provisioned on Compute engine instances that use Google's Container Optimised OS. This operating system implements a locked-down firewall, limited user accounts with root disabled and a read-only filesystem. There is a further option to enable GKE Sandbox for stronger isolation in multi-tenant deployment scenarios.
* Network security - Within a created cluster VPC, Anthos GKE leverages a powerful software-defined network that enables simple Pod-to-Pod communications. Network policies allow locking down ingress and egress connections in a given namespace. Filtering can also be implemented to incoming load-balanced traffic for services that require external access, by supplying whitelisted CIDR IP ranges.
* Workload security - Running workloads run with limited privileges, default Docker AppArmor security policies are applied to all Kubernetes Pods. Workload identity for Anthos GKE aligns with the open source kubernetes service accounts with GCP service account permissions.
* Audit logging - Adminstrators are given a way to retain, query, process and alert on events of the deployed environments.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How can workloads deployed on Anthos GKE on-prem clusters securely connect to Google Cloud services?</summary><br><b>

* Google Cloud Virtual Private Network (Cloud VPN) - this is for secure networking
* Google Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS) - for key management
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Island Mode configuration with regards to networking in Anthos GKE deployed on-prem?</summary><br><b>

* This is when pods can directly talk to each other within a cluster, but cannot be reached from outside the cluster thus forming an "island" within the network that is not connected to the external network.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Anthos Config Management</summary><br><b>

It is a core component of the Anthos stack which provides platform, service and security operators with a single, unified approach to multi-cluster management that spans both on-premises and cloud environments. It closely follows K8s best practices, favoring declarative approaches over imperative operations, and actively monitors cluster state and applies the desired state as defined in Git. It includes three key components as follows:

1. An importer that reads from a central Git repository
2. A component that synchronises stored configuration data into K8s objects
3. A component that monitors drift between desired and actual cluster configurations with a capability of reconciliation when need rises.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does Anthos Config Management help?</summary><br><b>

It follows common modern software development practices which makes cluster configuration, management and policy changes auditable, revertable, and versionable easily enforcing IT governance and unifying resource management in an organisation.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Anthos Service Mesh?</summary><br><b>

* It is a suite of tools that assist in monitoring and managing deployed services on Anthos of all shapes and sizes whether running in cloud, hybrid or multi-cloud environments. It leverages the APIs and core components from Istio, a highly configurable and open-source service mesh platform.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the two main components of Anthos Service Mesh</summary><br><b>

1. Data plane - it consists of a set of distributed proxies that mediate all inbound and outbound network traffic between individual services which are configured using a centralised control plane and an open API
2. Control plane - is a fully managed offering outside of Anthos GKE clusters to simplify management overhead and ensure highest possible availability.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the components of the managed control plane of Anthos Service Mesh?</summary><br><b>

1. Traffic Director - it is GCP's fully managed service mesh traffic control plane, responsible for translating Istio API objects into configuration information for the distributed proxies, as well as directing service mesh ingress and egress traffic
2. Managed CA - is a centralised certificate authority responsible for providing SSL certificates to each of the distributed proxies, authentication information and distributing secrets
3. Operations tooling - formerly stackdriver, provides a managed ingestion point for observability and telemetry, specifically monitoring, tracing and logging data generated by each of the proxies. This powers the observability dashboard for operators to visually inspect their services and service dependencies assisting in the implementation of SRE best practices for monitoring SLIs and establishing SLOs.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does Anthos Service Mesh help?</summary><br><b>
Tool and technology integration that makes up Anthos service mesh delivers signficant operational benefits to Anthos environments, with minimal additional overhead such as follows:

* Uniform observability - the data plane reports service to service communication back to the control plane generating a service dependency graph. Traffic inspection by the proxy inserts headers to facilitate distributed tracing, capturing and reporting service logs together with service-level metrics (i.e latency, errors, availability).
* Operational agility - fine-grained controls for managing the flow of inter-mesh (north-south) and intra-mesh (east-west) traffic are provided.
* Policy-driven security - policies can be enforced consistently across diverse protocols and runtimes as service communications are secured by default.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>List possible use cases of traffic controls that can be implemented within Anthos Service Mesh</summary><br><b>

* Traffic splitting across differing service versions for canary or A/B testing
* Circuit breaking to prevent cascading failures
* Fault injection to help build resilient and fault-tolerant deployments
* HTTP header-based traffic steering between individual services or versions
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Cloud Run for Anthos?</summary><br><b>

It is part of the Anthos stack that brings a serverless container experience to Anthos, offering a high-level platform experience on top of K8s clusters. It is built with Knative, an open-source operator for K8s that brings serverless application serving and eventing capabilities.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does Cloud Run for Anthos simplify operations?</summary><br><b>

Platform teams in organisations that wish to offer developers additional tools to test, deploy and run applications can use Knative to enhance this experience on Anthos as Cloud Run. Below are some of the benefits;

* Easy migration from K8s deployments - Without Cloud Run, platform engineers have to configure deployment, service, and HorizontalPodAutoscalers(HPA) objects to a loadbalancer and autoscaling. If application is already serving traffic it becomes hard to change configurations or roll back efficiently. Using Cloud Run all this is managed thus the Knative service manifest describes the application to be autoscaled and loadbalanced
* Autoscaling - a sudden traffic spike may cause application containers in K8s to crash due to overload thus an efficient automated autoscaling is executed to serve the high volume of traffic
* Networking - it has built-in load balancing capabilities and policies for traffic splitting between multiple versions of an application.
* Releases and rollouts - supports the notion of the Knatibe API's revisions which describe new versions or different configurations of your application and canary deployments by splitting traffic.
* Monitoring - observing and recording metrics such as latency, error rate and requests per second.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>List and explain three high-level out of the box autoscaling primitives offered by Cloud Run for Anthos that do not exist in K8s natively</summary><br><b>

* Rapid, request-based autoscaling - default autoscalers monitor request metrics which allows Cloud Run for Anthos to handle spiky traffic patterns smoothly
* Concurrency controls - limits such as max in-flight requests per container are enforced to ensure the container does not become overloaded and crash. More containers are added to handle the spiky traffic, buffering the requests.
* Scale to zero - if an application is inactive for a while Cloud Run scales it down to zero to reduce its footprint. Alternatively one can turn off scale-to-zero to prevent cold starts.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>List some Cloud Run for Anthos use cases</summary><br><b>

As it does not support stateful applications or sticky sessions, it is suitable for running stateless applications such as:

* Machine learning model predictions e.g Tensorflow serving containers
* API gateways, API middleware, web front ends and Microservices
* Event handlers, ETL

## Elastic

<details>
<summary>What is the Elastic Stack?</summary><br><b>

The Elastic Stack consists of:

  * Elasticsearch
  * Kibana
  * Logstash
  * Beats
  * Elastic Hadoop
  * APM Server

Elasticserach, Logstash and Kibana are also known as the ELK stack.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is Elasticsearch</summary><br><b>

From the official [docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/documents-indices.html):

"Elasticsearch is a distributed document store. Instead of storing information as rows of columnar data, Elasticsearch stores complex data structures that have been serialized as JSON documents"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Logstash?</summary><br><b>
	
From the [blog](https://logit.io/blog/post/the-top-50-elk-stack-and-elasticsearch-interview-questions):

"Logstash is a powerful, flexible pipeline that collects, enriches and transports data. It works as an extract, transform & load (ETL) tool for collecting log messages."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what beats are</summary><br><b>

Beats are lightweight data shippers. These data shippers installed on the client where the data resides.
Examples of beats: Filebeat, Metricbeat, Auditbeat. There are much more.<br>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Kibana?</summary><br><b>

From the official docs:

"Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch. You use Kibana to search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices. You can easily perform advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables, and maps."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe what happens from the moment an app logged some information until it's displayed to the user in a dashboard when the Elastic stack is used</summary><br><b>

The process may vary based on the chosen architecture and the processing you may want to apply to the logs. One possible workflow is:

1. The data logged by the application is picked by filebeat and sent to logstash
2. Logstash process the log based on the defined filters. Once done, the output is sent to Elasticsearch
2. Elasticsearch stores the document it got and the document is indexed for quick future access
4. The user creates visualizations in Kibana which based on the indexed data
5. The user creates a dashboard which composed out of the visualization created in the previous step
</b></details>

##### Elasticsearch

<details>
<summary>What is a data node?</summary><br><b>

This is where data is stored and also where different processing takes place (e.g. when you search for a data).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a master node?</summary><br><b>

Par of a master node responsibilites:
  * Track the status of all the nodes in the cluster
  * Verify replicas are working and the data is available from every data node.
  * No hot nodes (no data node that works much harder than other nodes)

While there can be multiple master nodes in reality only of them is the elected master node.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an ingest node?</summary><br><b>

A node which responsible for parsing the data. In case you don't use logstash then this node can recieve data from beats and parse it, similarly to how it can be parsed in Logstash.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Coordinating node?</summary><br><b>

A Coordinating node responsible for routing requests out and in to the cluser (data nodes).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How data is stored in elasticsearch?</summary><br><b>

* Data is stored in an index
* The index is spread across the cluster using shards
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an Index?</summary><br><b>

Index in Elastic is in most cases compared to a whole database from the SQL/NoSQL world.<br>
You can choose to have one index to hold all the data of your app or have multiple indices where each index holds different type of your app (e.g. index for each service your app is running).

The official docs also offer a great explanation (in general, it's really good documentation, as every project should have):

"An index can be thought of as an optimized collection of documents and each document is a collection of fields, which are the key-value pairs that contain your data"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Shards</summary><br><b>

An index is split into shards and documents are hashed to a particular shard. Each shard may be on a different node in a cluster and each one of the shards is a self contained index.<br>
This allows Elasticsearch to scale to an entire cluster of servers.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an Inverted Index?</summary><br><b>

From the official docs:

"An inverted index lists every unique word that appears in any document and identifies all of the documents each word occurs in."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Document?</summary><br><b>

Continuing with the comparison to SQL/NoSQL a Document in Elastic is a row in table in the case of SQL or a document in a collection in the case of NoSQL.
As in NoSQL a Document is a JSON object which holds data on a unit in your app. What is this unit depends on the your app. If your app related to book then each document describes a book. If you are app is about shirts then each document is a shirt.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You check the health of your elasticsearch cluster and it's red. What does it mean? What can cause the status to be yellow instead of green?</summary><br><b>

Red means some data is unavailable.
Yellow can be caused by running single node cluster instead of multi-node.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? Elasticsearch indexes all data in every field and each indexed field has the same data structure for unified and quick query ability</summary><br><b>

False.
From the official docs:

"Each indexed field has a dedicated, optimized data structure. For example, text fields are stored in inverted indices, and numeric and geo fields are stored in BKD trees."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What reserved fields a document has?</summary><br><b>

  * _index
  * _id
  * _type
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Mapping</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the advantages of defining your own mapping? (or: when would you use your own mapping?)</summary><br><b>

* You can optimize fields for partial matching
* You can define custom formats of known fields (e.g. date)
* You can perform language-specific analysis
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Replicas</summary><br><b>

In a network/cloud environment where failures can be expected any time, it is very useful and highly recommended to have a failover mechanism in case a shard/node somehow goes offline or disappears for whatever reason.
To this end, Elasticsearch allows you to make one or more copies of your index’s shards into what are called replica shards, or replicas for short.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Can you explain Term Frequency & Document Frequency?</summary><br><b>

Term Frequency is how often a term appears in a given document and Document Frequency is how often a term appears in all documents. They both are used for determining the relevance of a term by calculating Term Frequency / Document Frequency.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You check "Current Phase" under "Index lifecycle management" and you see it's set to "hot". What does it mean?</summary><br><b>

"The index is actively being written to".
More about the phases [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/ilm-policy-definition.html)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What this command does? <code>curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/customer/_doc/1?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{ "name": "John Doe" }'</code></summary><br><b>

It creates customer index if it doesn't exists and adds a new document with the field name which is set to "John Dow". Also, if it's the first document it will get the ID 1.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What will happen if you run the previous command twice? What about running it 100 times?</code></summary><br><b>

1. If name value was different then it would update "name" to the new value
2. In any case, it bumps version field by one
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the Bulk API? What would you use it for?</code></summary><br><b>

Bulk API is used when you need to index multiple documents. For high number of documents it would be significantly faster to use rather than individual requests since there are less network roundtrips.
</b></details>

##### Query DSL

<details>
<summary>Explain Elasticsearch query syntax (Booleans, Fields, Ranges)</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is Relevance Score</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Query Context and Filter Context</summary><br><b>

From the official docs:

"In the query context, a query clause answers the question “How well does this document match this query clause?” Besides deciding whether or not the document matches, the query clause also calculates a relevance score in the _score meta-field."

"In a filter context, a query clause answers the question “Does this document match this query clause?” The answer is a simple Yes or No — no scores are calculated. Filter context is mostly used for filtering structured data"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe how would an architecture of production environment with large amounts of data would be different from a small-scale environment</summary><br><b>

There are several possible answers for this question. One of them is as follows:

A small-scale architecture of elastic will consist of the elastic stack as it is. This means we will have beats, logstash, elastcsearch and kibana.<br>
A production environment with large amounts of data can include some kind of buffering component (e.g. Reddis or RabbitMQ) and also security component such as Nginx.
</b></details>

##### Logstash

<details>
<summary>What are Logstash plugins? What plugins types are there?</summary><br><b>

  * Input Plugins - how to collect data from different sources

##### Kibana

<details>
<summary>What can you find under "Discover" in Kibana?</summary><br><b>

The raw data as it is stored in the index. You can search and filter it.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You see in Kibana, after clicking on Discover, "561 hits". What does it mean?</summary><br><b>

Total number of documents matching the search results. If not query used then simply the total number of documents.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What can you find under "Visualize"?</summary><br><b>

"Visualize" is where you can create visual representations for your data (pie charts, graphs, ...)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What visualization types are supported/included in Kibana?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What visualization type would you use for statistical outliers</summary><br><b>

#### Elastic Stack

<details>
<summary>How do you secure an Elastic Stack?</summary><br><b>

You can generate certificates with the provided elastic utils and change configuration to enable security using certificates model.
</b></details>

## Distributed

<details>
<summary>Explain Distributed Computing (or Distributed System)</summary><br><b>

According to Martin Kleppmann:

"Many processes running on many machines...only message-passing via an unreliable network with variable delays, and the system may suffer from partial failures, unreliable clocks, and process pauses."

Another definition: "Systems that are physically separated, but logically connected"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What can cause a system to fail?</summary><br><b>

* Network
* CPU
* Memory
* Disk
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Do you know what is "CAP theorem"? (aka as Brewer's theorem)</summary><br><b>

According to the CAP theorem, it's not possible for a distributed data store to provide more than two of the following at the same time:

* Availability: Every request receives a response (it doesn't has to be the most recent data)
* Consistency: Every request receives a response with the latest/most recent data
* Partition tolerance: Even if some the data is lost/dropped, the system keeps running
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the problems with the following design? How to improve it?<br>
<img src="images/distributed/distributed_design_standby.png" width="500x;" height="350px;"/>
</summary><br><b>
1. The transition can take time. In other words, noticeable downtime.
2. Standby server is a waste of resources - if first application server is running then the standby does nothing
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the problems with the following design? How to improve it?<br>
<img src="images/distributed/distributed_design_lb.png" width="700x;" height="350px;"/>
</summary><br><b>
Issues:
If load balancer dies , we lose the ability to communicate with the application.

Ways to improve:
* Add another load balancer
* Use DNS A record for both load balancers
* Use message queue
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is "Shared-Nothing" architecture?</summary><br><b>

It's an architecture in which data is and retrieved from a single, non-shared, source usually exclusively connected to one node as opposed to architectures where the request can get to one of many nodes and the data will be retrieved from one shared location (storage, memory, ...).

<summary>What happens when you type in a URL in an address bar in a browser?</summary><br><b>

1. The browser searches for the record of the domain name IP address in the DNS in the following order:
  * Browser cache
  * Operating system cache
  * The DNS server configured on the user's system (can be ISP DNS, public DNS, ...)
2. If it couldn't find a DNS record locally, a full DNS resolution is started.
3. It connects to the server using the TCP protocol
4. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server
5. The server sends an HTTP response back to the browser
6. The browser renders the response (e.g. HTML)
7. The browser then sends subsequent requests as needed to the server to get the embedded links, javascript, images in the HTML and then steps 3 to 5 are repeated.

#### API

<details>
<summary>Explain what is an API</summary><br><b>

I like this definition from [blog.christianposta.com](https://blog.christianposta.com/microservices/api-gateways-are-going-through-an-identity-crisis):

"An explicitly and purposefully defined interface designed to be invoked over a network that enables software developers to get programmatic access to data and functionality within an organization in a controlled and comfortable way."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an API specification?</summary><br><b>

From [swagger.io](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/difference-between-api-documentation-specification):

"An API specification provides a broad understanding of how an API behaves and how the API links with other APIs. It explains how the API functions and the results to expect when using the API"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? API Definition is the same as API Specification</summary><br><b>

False. From [swagger.io](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/difference-between-api-documentation-specification):

"An API definition is similar to an API specification in that it provides an understanding of how an API is organized and how the API functions. But the API definition is aimed at machine consumption instead of human consumption of APIs."

<details>
<summary>Explain what is "X-Forwarded-For"</summary><br><b>

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Forwarded-For): "The X-Forwarded-For (XFF) HTTP header field is a common method for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or load balancer."
</b></details>

#### Load Balancers

<details>
<summary>What is a load balancer?</summary><br><b>

A load balancer accepts (or denies) incoming network traffic from a client, and based on some criteria (application related, network, etc.) it distributes those communications out to servers (at least one).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why to used a load balancer?</summary><br><b>

* Scalability - using a load balancer, you can possibly add more servers in the backend to handle more requests/traffic from the clients, as opposed to using one server.
* Redundancy - if one server in the backend dies, the load balancer will keep forwarding the traffic/requests to the second server so users won't even notice one of the servers in the backend is down.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What load balancer techniques/algorithms are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

  * Round Robin
  * Weighted Round Robin
  * Least Connection
  * Weighted Least Connection
  * Resource Based
  * Fixed Weighting
  * Weighted Response Time
  * Source IP Hash
  * URL Hash
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the drawbacks of round robin algorithm in load balancing?</summary><br><b>

  * A simple round robin algorithm knows nothing about the load and the spec of each server it forwards the requests to. It is possible, that multiple heavy workloads requests will get to the same server while other servers will got only lightweight requests which will result in one server doing most of the work, maybe even crashing at some point because it unable to handle all the heavy workloads requests by its own.
  * Each request from the client creates a whole new session. This might be a problem for certain scenarios where you would like to perform multiple operations where the server has to know about the result of operation so basically, being sort of aware of the history it has with the client. In round robin, first request might hit server X, while second request might hit server Y and ask to continue processing the data that was processed on server X already.

#### Load Balancers - Sticky Sessions

<details>
<summary>What are sticky sessions? What are their pros and cons?</summary><br><b>

Recommended read:
  * [Red Hat Article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/900933)

Cons:
  * Can cause uneven load on instance (since requests routed to the same instances)
Pros:
  * Ensures in-proc sessions are not lost when a new request is created
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Name one use case for using sticky sessions</summary><br><b>

You would like to make sure the user doesn't lose the current session data.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What sticky sessions use for enabling the "stickiness"?</summary><br><b>

Cookies. There are application based cookies and duration based cookies.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain application-based cookies</summary><br><b>

* Generated by the application and/or the load balancer
* Usually allows to include custom data
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain duration-based cookies</summary><br><b>

* Generated by the load balancer
* Session is not sticky anymore once the duration elapsed
</b></details>

#### Load Balancers - Load Balancing Algorithms

  * Fixed Weighting
  * Weighted Response Time
  * Source IP Hash
  * URL Hash
</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain use case for connection draining?</summary><br><b>
To ensure that a Classic Load Balancer stops sending requests to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy, while keeping the existing connections open, use connection draining. This enables the load balancer to complete in-flight requests made to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy.

The maximum timeout value can be set between 1 and 3,600 seconds on both GCP and AWS.

## Questions you CAN ask

<a name="questions-you-ask"></a>

A list of questions you as a candidate can ask the interviewer during or after the interview.
These are only a suggestion, use them carefully. Not every interviewer will be able to answer these (or happy to) which should be perhaps a red flag warning for your regarding working in such place but that's really up to you.

<details>
<summary>What do you like about working here?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does the company promote personal growth?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the current level of technical debt you are dealing with?</summary><br><b>

Be careful when asking this question - all companies, regardless of size, have some level of tech debt.
Phrase the question in the light that all companies have the deal with this, but you want to see the current
pain points they are dealing with <br>

This is a great way to figure how managers deal with unplanned work, and how good they are at
setting expectations with projects.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why I should NOT join you? (or 'what you don't like about working here?')</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What was your favorite project you've worked on?</summary><br><b>

This can give you insights in some of the cool projects a company is working on, and if
you would enjoy working on projects like these. This is also a good way to see if
the managers are allowing employees to learn and grow with projects outside of the
normal work you'd do.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>If you could change one thing about your day to day, what would it be?</summary><br><b>

Similar to the tech debt question, this helps you identify any pain points with the company.
Additionally, it can be a great way to show how you'd be an asset to the team.<br>

For Example, if they mention they have problem X, and you've solved that in the past,
you can show how you'd be able to mitigate that problem.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Let's say that we agree and you hire me to this position, after X months, what do you expect that I have achieved?</summary><br><b>

Not only this will tell you what is expected from you, it will also provide big hint on the type of work you are going to do in the first months of your job.

## Databases

|Name|Topic|Objective & Instructions|Solution|Comments|
|--------|--------|------|----|----|
| Message Board Tables  | Relational DB Tables | [Exercise](exercises/databases/table_for_message_board_system.md) | [Solution](exercises/databases/solutions/table_for_message_board_system.md)

<details>
<summary>What is a relational database?</summary><br><b>

  * Data Storage: system to store data in tables
  * SQL: programming language to manage relational databases
  * Data Definition Language: a standard syntax to create, alter and delete tables
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What does it mean when a database is ACID compliant?</summary><br>

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. In order to be ACID compliant, the database must meet each of the four criteria

**Atomicity** - When a change occurs to the database, it should either succeed or fail as a whole.

For example, if you were to update a table, the update should completely execute. If it only partially executes, the
update is considered failed as a whole, and will not go through - the DB will revert back to it's original
state before the update occurred. It should also be mentioned that Atomicity ensures that each
transaction is completed as it's own stand alone "unit" - if any part fails, the whole statement fails.

**Consistency** - any change made to the database should bring it from one valid state into the next.

For example, if you make a change to the DB, it shouldn't corrupt it. Consistency is upheld by checks and constraints that
are pre-defined in the DB. For example, if you tried to change a value from a string to an int when the column
should be of datatype string, a consistent DB would not allow this transaction to go through, and the action would
not be executed

**Isolation** - this ensures that a database will never be seen "mid-update" - as multiple transactions are running at
the same time, it should still leave the DB in the same state as if the transactions were being run sequentially.

For example, let's say that 20 other people were making changes to the database at the same time. At the
time you executed your query, 15 of the 20 changes had gone through, but 5 were still in progress. You should
only see the 15 changes that had completed - you wouldn't see the database mid-update as the change goes through.

**Durability** - Once a change is committed, it will remain committed regardless of what happens
(power failure, system crash, etc.). This means that all completed transactions
must be recorded in non-volatile memory.

Note that SQL is by nature ACID compliant. Certain NoSQL DB's can be ACID compliant depending on
how they operate, but as a general rule of thumb, NoSQL DB's are not considered ACID compliant

<summary>What is sharding?</summary><br><b>

Sharding is a horizontal partitioning.

Are you able to explain what is it good for?
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You find out your database became a bottleneck and users experience issues accessing data. How can you deal with such situation?</summary><br><b>

Not much information provided as to why it became a bottleneck and what is current architecture, so one general approach could be<br>
to reduce the load on your database by moving frequently-accessed data to in-memory structure.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a connection pool?</summary><br><b>

Connection Pool is a cache of database connections and the reason it's used is to avoid an overhead of establishing a connection for every query done to a database.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a connection leak?</summary><br><b>

A connection leak is a situation where database connection isn't closed after being created and is no longer needed.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Table Lock?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Your database performs slowly than usual. More specifically, your queries are taking a lot of time. What would you do?</summary><br><b>

* Query for running queries and cancel the irrelevant queries
* Check for connection leaks (query for running connections and include their IP)
* Check for table locks and kill irrelevant locking sessions
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Data Warehouse?</summary><br><b>

"A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant and non-volatile collection of data in support of organisation's decision-making process"

<summary>What is OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an index in a database?</summary><br><b>

A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of operations in a table. Indexes can be created using one or more columns, providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient ordering of access to records.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What data types are there in relational databases?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Normalization</summary><br><b>

Data that is used multiple times in a database should be stored once and referenced with a foreign key.<br>
This has the clear benefit of ease of maintenance where you need to change a value only in a single place to change it everywhere.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key</summary><br><b>

Primary Key: each row in every table should a unique identifier that represents the row.<br>
Foreign Key: a reference to another table's primary key. This allows you to join table together to retrieve all the information you need without duplicating data.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What types of data tables have you used?</summary><br><b>

  * Primary data table: main data you care about
  * Details table: includes a foreign key and has one to many relationship
  * Lookup values table: can be one table per lookup or a table containing all the lookups and has one to many relationship
  * Multi reference table
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is ORM? What benefits it provides in regards to relational databases usage?</summary><br><b>

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping): "is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages"

In regards to the relational databases:

  * Database as code
  * Database abstraction
  * Encapsulates SQL complexity
  * Enables code review process
  * Enables usage as a native OOP structure

The load on the producers or consumers may be high which will then cause them to hang or crash.<br>
Instead of working in "push mode", the consumers can pull tasks only when they are ready to handle them. It can be fixed by using a streaming platform like Kafka, Kinesis, etc. This platform will make sure to handle the high load/traffic and pass tasks/messages to consumers only when the ready to get them.

## Hardware

<details>
<summary>What is a CPU?</summary><br><b>

A central processing unit (CPU) performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program. This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry, and specialized processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is RAM?</summary><br><b>

RAM (Random Access Memory) is the hardware in a computing device where the operating system (OS), application programs and data in current use are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device's processor. RAM is the main memory in a computer. It is much faster to read from and write to than other kinds of storage, such as a hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD) or optical drive.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an embedded system?</summary><br><b>

An embedded system is a computer system - a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts.

## Big Data

<details>
<summary>Explain what is exactly Big Data</summary><br><b>

As defined by Doug Laney:

* Volume: Extremely large volumes of data
* Velocity: Real time, batch, streams of data
* Variety: Various forms of data, structured, semi-structured and unstructured
* Veracity or Variability: Inconsistent, sometimes inaccurate, varying data

<details>
<summary>What is DataOps? How is it related to DevOps?</summary><br><b>

 DataOps seeks to reduce the end-to-end cycle time of data analytics, from the origin of ideas to the literal creation of charts, graphs and models that create value. 
 DataOps combines Agile development, DevOps and statistical process controls and applies them to data analytics.

<summary>What is Data Architecture?</summary><br><b>

An answer from [talend.com](https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-data-architecture):

"Data architecture is the process of standardizing how organizations collect, store, transform, distribute, and use data. The goal is to deliver relevant data to people who need it, when they need it, and help them make sense of it."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the different formats of data</summary><br><b>

* Structured - data that has defined format and length (e.g. numbers, words)
* Semi-structured - Doesn't conform to a specific format but is self-describing (e.g. XML, SWIFT)
* Unstructured - does not follow a specific format (e.g. images, test messages)

## Packer

<details>
<summary>What is Packer? What is it used for?</summary><br><b>

In general, Packer automates machine images creation.
It allows you to focus on configuration prior to deployment while making the images. This allows you start the instances much faster in most cases.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Packer follows a "configuration->deployment" model or "deployment->configuration"?</summary><br><b>

A configuration->deployment which has some advantages like:

1. Deployment Speed - you configure once prior to deployment instead of configuring every time you deploy. This allows you to start instances/services much quicker.
2. More immutable infrastructure - with configuration->deployment it's not likely to have very different deployments since most of the configuration is done prior to the deployment. Issues like dependencies errors are handled/discovered prior to deployment in this model.
