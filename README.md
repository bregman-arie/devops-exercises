# DevOps Interview Questions


:information_source: &nbsp;This repository contains interview questions on various DevOps related topics

:bar_chart: &nbsp;There are currently **399** questions


:warning: &nbsp;You don't need to know how to answer all the questions in this repo. DevOps is not about knowing all :)

:page_facing_up: &nbsp;Different interviewers focus on different things. Some will focus on your resume while others might focus on scenario questions or specific technical questions. In this repository I tried to cover different types of questions for you to practice and test your knowledge

:pencil: &nbsp;You can add more questions & answers by submitting pull requests :)

#### :baby: Beginner

<details>
<summary>What is DevOps? What DevOps helps us to achieve?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the anti-patterns of DevOps?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Continuous Integration?</summary><br><b>

A development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently. It can range from a couple of changes every day or a week to a couple of changes in one hour in larger scales.

Each piece of code (change/patch) is verified, to make the change is safe to merge. Today, it's a common practice to test the change using an automated build that makes sure the code can integrated. It can be one build which runs several tests in different levels (unit, functional, etc.) or several separate builds that all or some has to pass in order for the change to be merged into the repository.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Continuous Deployment?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Continuous Delivery?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What do you consider as best practices for CI/CD?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What systems and/or tools are you using for the following?:

  * CI/CD
  * Provisioning infrastructure
  * Configuration Management
  * Monitoring & alerting
  * Logging
  * Code review
  * Code coverage
  * Tests</summary><br><b>
  * CI/CD - Jenkins, Circle CI, Travis
  * Provisioning infrastructure - Terraform, CloudFormation
  * Configuration Management - Ansible, Puppet, Chef
  * Monitoring & alerting - Prometheus, Nagios
  * Logging - Logstash, Graylog, Fluentd
  * Code review - Gerrit, Review Board
  * Code coverage - Cobertura, Clover, JaCoCo
  * Tests - Robot, Serenity, Gauge
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are you taking into consideration when choosing a tool/technology?</summary><br><b>

You may use one or all of the following:
  * mature vs. cutting edge
  * community size
  * architecture aspects - agent vs. agentless, master vs. masterless, etc.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What the difference between VPN and VPS?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What scripting language are you familiar with? why specifically this one?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How long do you think it would take you to learn another language?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain mutable vs. immutable infrastructure</summary><br><b>

In mutable infrastructure paradigm, changes applied on top of the existing infrastructure and over time
the infrastructure builds up a history of changes. Ansible, Puppet and Chef are examples to tools which
follow mutable infrastructure paradigm.

In immutable infrastructure paradigm, every change is actually new infrastructure. So a change
to a server will result in a new server instead of updating it. Terraform is an example of technology
which follows the immutable infrastructure paradigm.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What ways are you familiar with to deliver a software?</summary><br><b>

  * Archive - collect all your app files into one archive (e.g. tar) and deliver it to the user.
  * Package - depends on the OS, you can use your OS package format (e.g. in RHEL/Fefodra it's RPM) to deliver your software with a way to install, uninstall and update it using the standard packager commands
  * Images - Either VM or container images where your package is included with everything it needs in order to run successfully.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is caching? How it works? Why is it important?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain stateless vs. stateful</summary><br><b>

<details>
<summary>What is HTTP and how it works?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the workflow of setting up some type of web server (Apache, IIS, Tomact, ...)</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain monitoring. What is it? Why it's important?</summary><br><b>

<details>
<summary>How do you measure your CI/CD quality? Are there any metrics you are using?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a configuration drift? What problems is it causing?</summary><br><b>

Configuration drift happens when in an environment of servers with the exact same configuration and software, a certain server
or servers are being applied with updates or configuration which other servers don't get and over time these servers become
slightly different than all others.

This situation might lead to bugs which hard to identify and reproduce.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to deal with configuration drift?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Do you have experience with testing cross-projects changes? (aka cross-dependency)</summary><br><b>

Note: cross-dependency is when you have two or more changes to separate projects and you would like to test them in mutual build instead of testing each change separately.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>In what scenarios would you prefer to use SQL?</summary><br><b>

  * Homogeneous data, no changes anticipated
  * ACID compliance is important
</b></details>

<summary>What is CSMA/CD? Is it used in modern ethernet networks?</summary><br><b>

CSMA/CD stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection.
Its primarily focus it to manage access to shared medium/bus where only one host can transmit at a given point of time.

CSMA/CD algorithm:

1. Before sending a frame, it checks whether another host already transmitting a frame.
2. If no one transmitting, it starts transmitting the frame.
3. If two hosts transmitted at the same time, we have a collision.
4. Both hosts stop sending the frame and they send to everyone a 'jam signal' notifying everyone that a collision occured
5. They are waiting for a random time before sending again
6. Once each host waited for a raondom time, they try to send the frame again and so the

Kerberos
File descriptor, also known as file handler, is a unique number which identifies an open file in the operating system.

In Linux (and Unix) the first three file descriptors are:
  * 0 - the default data stream for input

## Ansible

<a name="ansible-beginner"></a>
#### :baby: Beginner

<details>
<summary>Describe each of the following components in Ansible, including the relationship between them:

  * Task
  * Module
  * Play
  * Playbook
  * Role</summary><br><b>

Task – a call to a specific Ansible module
Module – the actual unit of code executed by Ansible on your own host or a remote host. Modules are indexed by category (database, file, network, …) and also referred as task plugins.

Play – One or more tasks executed on a given host(s)

Playbook – One or more plays. Each play can be executed on the same or different hosts

Role – Ansible roles allows you to group resources based on certain functionality/service such that they can be easily reused. In a role, you have directories for variables, defaults, files, templates, handlers, tasks, and metadata. You can then use the role by simply specifying it in your playbook.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Which Ansible best practices are you familiar with? name at least three</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an inventory file and how you define one?</summary><br><b>

An inventory file defines hosts and/or groups of hosts on which Ansible tasks executed upon.

An example of inventory file:

192.168.1.2
192.168.1.3
192.168.1.4

[web_servers]
190.40.2.20
190.40.2.21
190.40.2.22
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a dynamic inventory file? When you would use one?</summary><br><br>

A dynamic inventory file tracks hosts from one or more sources like cloud providers and CMDB systems.

You should use one when using external sources and especially when the hosts in your environment are being automatically<br>
spun up and shut down, without you tracking every change in these sources.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You want to run Ansible playbook only on specific minor version of your OS, how would you achieve that?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Write a task to create the directory ‘/tmp/new_directory’</summary><br><b>

```
- name: Create a new directory
  file:
      path: "/tmp/new_directory"
      state: directory
```
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What would be the result of the following play?</summary><br><b>

```
---
- name: Print information about my host
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: 'no'                                                                                                                                                                           
  tasks:
      - name: Print hostname
        debug:
            msg: "It's me, {{ ansible_hostname }}"
```

When given a written code, always inspect it thoroughly. If your answer is “this will fail” then you are right. We are using a fact (ansible_hostname), which is a gathered piece of information from the host we are running on. But in this case, we disabled facts gathering (gather_facts: no) so the variable would be undefined which will result in failure.

```

The content of the system_info.j2 template

```
# {{ ansible_managed }}
I'm {{ ansible_hostname }} and my operating system is {{ ansible_distribution }
```

<details>
<summary>The variable 'whoami' defined in the following places:

  * role defaults -> whoami: mario
  * extra vars (variables you pass to Ansible CLI with -e) -> whoami: toad
  * host facts -> whoami: luigi
  * inventory variables (doesn’t matter which type) -> whoami: browser

According to variable precedence, which one will be used?</summary><br><b>

The right answer is ‘toad’.

Variable precedence is about how variables override each other when they set in different locations. If you didn’t experience it so far I’m sure at some point you will, which makes it a useful topic to be aware of.

In the context of our question, the order will be extra vars (always override any other variable) -> host facts -> inventory variables -> role defaults (the weakest).

A full list can be found at the link above. Also, note there is a significant difference between Ansible 1.x and 2.x.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>For each of the following statements determine if it's true or false:

  * A module is a collection of tasks
  * It’s better to use shell or command instead of a specific module
  * Host facts override play variables
  * A role might include the following: vars, meta, and handlers
  * Dynamic inventory is generated by extracting information from external sources
  * It’s a best practice to use indention of 2 spaces instead of 4
  * ‘notify’ used to trigger handlers
  * This “hosts: all:!controllers” means ‘run only on controllers group hosts</summary><br><b>

<details>
<summary>Can you explain what is Terraform? How it works?</summary><br><b>

Read [here](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html#what-is-terraform-)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What benefits infrastructure-as-code has?</summary><br><b>

- fully automated process of provisioning, modifying and deleting your infrastructure
- version control for your infrastructure which allows you to quickly rollback to previous versions
- validate infrastructure quality and stability with automated tests and code reviews
- makes infrastructure tasks less repetitive
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why Terraform and not other technologies? (e.g. Ansible, Puppet, CloufFormation)</summary><br><b>

A common *wrong* answer is to say that Ansible and Puppet are configuration management tools
and Terraform is a provisioning tool. While technically true, it doesn't mean Ansible and Puppet can't
be used for provisioning infrastructure. Also, it doesn't explain why Terraform should be used over
CloudFormation if at all.

The benefits of Terraform over the other tools:

  * It follows the immutable infrastructure approach which has benefits like avoiding a configuration drift over time
  * Ansible and Puppet are more procedural (you mention what to execute in each step) and Terraform is declartive since you describe the overall desired state and not per resource or task. You can give the example of going from 1 to 2 servers in each tool. In terrform you specify 2, in Ansible and puppet you have to only provision 1 additional server so you need to explicitly make sure you provision only another one server.

<code>terraform init</code> scans your code to figure which providers are you using and download them.
<code>terraform plan</code> will let you see what terraform is about to do before actually doing it.
<code>terraform apply</code> will provision the resources specified in the .tf files.
</b></details>

run multiple machines each with its own OS.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>In which scenarios would you use containers and in which you would prefer to use VMs?</summary><br><b>

You should choose VMs when:
  * you need run an application which requires all the resources and functionalilies of an OS
  * you need full isolation and security

You should choose containers when:
  * you need a lightweight solution that quickly starts
  * Running multiple versions or instances of a single application

```
1. It is a high level general purpose programming language created in 1991 by Guido Van Rosum.
2. The language is interpreted, being the CPython (Written in C) the most used/maintained implementation.
3. It is strongly typed. The typing discipline is duck typing and gradual.
4. Python focuses on readability and makes use of whitespaces/identation instead of brackets { }
5. The python packate manager is called PIP "pip installs packages", having more than 200.000 available packages.
6. Python comes with pip installed and a big standard library that offers the programmer many precooked solutions.
7. In python **Everything** is an object.

There are many other characteristics but these are the main ones that every python programmer should know.

<summary>What data types supported in Python and which of them are mutable? How can you show that a certain data type is mutable?</summary><br><b>

The mutable data types are:

    List
    Dictionary
    Set
    
The immutable data types are:

    Numbers (int, float, ...)
    String
    Bool
    Tuple
    Frozenset

You can usually use the function hash() to check an object mutability, if it is hashable it is immutable, although this does not always work as intended as user defined objects might be mutable and hashable

<summary>What is PEP8? Give an example of 3 style guidelines</summary><br><b>

PEP8 is a list of coding conventions and style guidelines for Python

5 style guidelines:

    1. Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
    2. Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
    3. Use commas when making a tuple of one element
    4. Use spaces (and not tabs) for indentation
    5. Use 4 spaces per indentation level

<summary>Explain inheritance and how to use it in Python</summary><br><b>

```
By definition inheritance is the mechanism where an object acts as a base of another object, retaining all its
properties.

So if Class B inherits from Class A, every characteristics from class A will be also available in class B.
Class A would be the 'Base class' and B class would be the 'derived class'.

This comes handy when you have several classes that share the same functionalities.

The basic syntax is:

class Base: pass

class Derived(Base): pass

A more forged example:

class Animal:
    def __init__(self):
        print("and I'm alive!")

    def eat(self, food):
        print("ñom ñom ñom", food)

class Human(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        print('My name is ', name)
        super().__init__()

    def write_poem(self):
        print('Foo bar bar foo foo bar!')

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        print('My name is', name)
        super().__init__()

    def bark(self):
        print('woof woof')


michael = Human('Michael')
michael.eat('Spam')
michael.write_poem()

bruno = Dog('Bruno')
bruno.eat('bone')
bruno.bark()

>>> My name is  Michael
>>> and I'm alive!
>>> ñom ñom ñom Spam
>>> Foo bar bar foo foo bar!
>>> My name is Bruno
>>> and I'm alive!
>>> ñom ñom ñom bone
>>> woof woof

Calling super() calls the Base method, thus, calling super().__init__() we called the Animal __init__.

There is a more advanced python feature called MetaClasses that aid the programmer to directly control class creation.

<summary> What is an error? What is an exception? What types of exceptions are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

```

#  Note that you generally don't need to know the compiling process but knowing where everything comes from
#  and giving complete answers shows that you truly know what you are talking about.

Generally, every compiling process have a two steps.
    - Analysis
    - Code Generation.
    
    Analysis can be broken into:
        1. Lexycal analysis   (Tokenizes source code)
        2. Syntactic analysis (Check whether the tokens are legal or not, tldr, if syntax is correct)
           
               for i in 'foo'
                          ^
             SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
        We missed ':'
        
        
        3. Semantic analysis  (Contextual analysis, legal syntax can still trigger errors, did you try to divide by 0,
          hash a mutable object or use an undeclared function?)
          
                 1/0
                ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
        
    These three analysis steps are the responsible for error handlings.
    
    The second step would be responsible for errors, mostly syntax errors, the most common error.
    The third step would be responsible for Exceptions.
    
    As we have seen, Exceptions are semantic errors, there are many builtin Exceptions:
        
        ImportError
        ValueError
        KeyError
        FileNotFoundError
        IndentationError
        IndexError
        ...
    
    You can also have user defined Exceptions that have to inherit from the `Exception` class, directly or indirectly.

    Basic example:
        
    class DividedBy2Error(Exception):
        def __init__(self, message):
            self.message = message
    
    
    def division(dividend,divisor):
        if divisor == 2:
            raise DividedBy2Error('I dont want you to divide by 2!')
        return dividend / divisor
    
    division(100, 2)
    
    >>> __main__.DividedBy2Error: I dont want you to divide by 2!

```

<summary>What is the difference between <code>git pull</code> and <code>git fetch</code>?</summary><br><b>

Shortly, git pull = git fetch + git merge

git fetch gets all the changes from the remote repository, stores the changes in
a separate branch in your local repository

<summary>Explain the following: <code>git directory</code>, <code>working directory</code> and <code>staging area</code></summary><br><b>

The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.

The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.

The staging area is a simple file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. It’s sometimes referred to as the index, but it’s becoming standard to refer to it as the staging area.

## SQL

#### :baby: Beginner

<details>
<summary>What does SQL stand for?</summary><br><b>

Structured Query Language

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How is SQL Different from NoSQL</summary><br><b>

The main difference is that SQL databases are structured (data is stored in the form of
tables with rows and columns - like an excel spreadsheet table) while NoSQL is 
unstructured, and the data storage can vary depending on how the NoSQL DB is set up, such
as key-value pair, document-oriented, etc.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What does it mean when a database is ACID compliant?</summary><br>

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. In order to be ACID compliant, the database much meet each of the four criteria

**Atomicity** - When a change occurs to the database, it should either succeed or fail as a whole. 

For example, if you were to update a table, the update should completely execute. If it only partially executes, the 
update is considered failed as a whole, and will not go through - the DB will revert back to it's original
state before the update occurred. It should also be mentioned that Atomicity ensures that each 
transaction is completed as it's own stand alone "unit" - if any part fails, the whole statement fails.

**Consistency** - any change made to the database should bring it from one valid state into the next.

For example, if you make a change to the DB, it shouldn't corrupt it. Consistency is upheld by checks and constraints that
are pre-defined in the DB. For example, if you tried to change a value from a string to an int when the column
should be of datatype string, a consistent DB would not allow this transaction to go through, and the action would
not be executed

**Isolation** - this ensures that a database will never be seen "mid-update" - as multiple transactions are running at
the same time, it should still leave the DB in the same state as if the transactions were being run sequentially.

For example, let's say that 20 other people were making changes to the database at the same time. At the
time you executed your query, 15 of the 20 changes had gone through, but 5 were still in progress. You should
only see the 15 changes that had completed - you wouldn't see the database mid-update as the change goes through.

**Durability** - Once a change is committed, it will remain committed regardless of what happens
(power failure, system crash, etc.). This means that all completed transactions 
must be recorded in non-voliatile memory. 

Note that SQL is by nature ACID compliant. Certain NoSQL DB's can be ACID compliant depending on 
how they operate, but as a general rule of thumb, NoSQL DB's are not considered ACID compliant
</details>

<details>
<summary>When is it best to use SQL? NoSQL?</summary><br><b>

SQL - Best used when data integrity is crucial. SQL is typically implemented with many
businesses and areas within the finance field due to it's ACID compliance.

NoSQL - Great if you need to scale things quickly. NoSQL was designed with web applications 
in mind, so it works great if you need to quickly spread the same information around to 
multiple servers

Additionally, since NoSQL does not adhere to the strict table with columns and rows structure
that Relational Databases require, you can store different data types together.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Cartesian Product?</summary><br>

A Cartesian product is when all rows from the first table are joined to all rows in the second
table. This can be done implicitly by not defining a key to join, or explicitly by 
calling a CROSS JOIN on two tables, such as below:

Select * from customers **CROSS JOIN** orders;

Note that a Cartesian product can also be a bad thing - when performing a join
on two tables in which both do not have unique keys, this could cause the returned information
to be incorrect.

<details>
<summary>How would I select all fields from this table?</summary><br><b>

Select * <br>
From Customers;
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How many items are in John's cart?</summary><br><b>

Select Items_in_cart <br>
From Customers <br>
Where Customer_Name = "John Smith";
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the sum of all the cash spent across all customers?</summary><br><b>

Select SUM(Cash_spent_to_Date) as SUM_CASH <br>
From Customers;
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How many people have items in their cart?</summary><br><b>

Select count(1) as Number_of_People_w_items <br>
From Customers <br>
where Items_in_cart > 0;
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you join the customer table to the order table?</summary><br><b>

You would join them on the unique key. In this case, the unique key is Customer_ID in
both the Customers table and Orders table
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you show which customer ordered which items?</summary><br><b>

Select c.Customer_Name, o.Item <br>
From Customers c <br>
Left Join Orders o <br>
  On c.Customer_ID = o.Customer_ID;

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Using a with statement, how would you show who ordered cat food, and the total amount of money spent?</summary><br><b>

with cat_food as ( <br>
Select Customer_ID, SUM(Price) as TOTAL_PRICE <br>
From Orders <br>
Where Item like "%Cat Food%" <br>
Group by Customer_ID <br>
) <br>
Select Customer_name, TOTAL_PRICE <br>
From Customers c <br>
Inner JOIN cat_food f <br>
  ON c.Customer_ID = f.Customer_ID <br>
where c.Customer_ID in (Select Customer_ID from cat_food);

Although this was a simple statement, the "with" clause really shines when 
a complex query needs to be run on a table before joining to another. With statements are nice, 
because you create a pseudo temp when running your query, instead of creating a whole new table.

The Sum of all the purchases of cat food weren't readily available, so we used a with statement to create
the pseudo table to retrieve the sum of the prices spent by each customer, then join the table normally.
