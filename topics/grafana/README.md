<summary>How can we install plugins for Grafana?</summary><br><b>

[Grafana getting started](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/plugins/installation/): Navigate to the [Grafana plugins page](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/), find the desired plugin and click on it, then click the installation tab. There are two ways to install depending on where your Grafana server is running:
- Cloud: On the **For** field of the installation tab, select the name of the organization you want to install the plugin on (unless you are only part of one), then click **install plugin**. Grafana cloud will automatically install the plugin to your Grafana instance, 
you may need to log out and back in to see the plugin.
- Local grafana: You can use the Grafana CLI which lets you list available plugins and install them.
```
grafana-cli plugins list-remote
grafana-cli plugins install <plugin-id>
```
You can also install a packaged plugin by downloading the asset from the installation tab, then extract the archive into the plugin directory. The path to the plugin directory can be seen in the configuration file 
 ```
 unzip my-plugin-0.2.0.zip -d YOUR_PLUGIN_DIR/my-plugin
 ```

<summary>Explain how we can add Custom configuration to Grafana</summary><br><b>

[Grafana docs](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/configuration/): 
The custom configuration can be configured, either by modifying the custom configuration file or by adding environment variables that overrides default configuration. The configuration varies depending on the OS:
- Windows: There is a file ```sample.ini``` in the same directory as the defaults.ini file, copy sample.ini and name it ```custom.ini```. Uncomment the settings you want to override.
- Linux: Edit the configuration file at ```/etc/grafana/grafana.ini```
- macOS: Add a configuration file named ```custom.ini``` in the conf folder, if you installed Grafana using Homebrew then you can manually edit the ```conf/defaults.ini```
- Docker: You can override existing configuration in Grafana with environmental variables. An example is setting the Grafana instance name: ```E.g. export GF_DEFAULT_INSTANCE_NAME=my-instance```
