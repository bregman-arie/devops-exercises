# devops-interview-questions and guidance
Repository with DevOps interview questions.

## Intervew guidance

* Even if we pressed by time, HRs etc. - we shouldn't low our expectation from the candidate. Because bad engineer in the team will actually make things worse for us and we will have even less time to work on IT infrastructure.
* For DevOps engineers ask more questions about DevOps/NetOps/SysOps with a bit of DBRE and SecOps questions.
* For DBRE concentrate more on DBRE questions with a bit of a DevOps/NetOps/SysOps/SecOps questions.
* For DevSecOps, ask about deep TCP/IP knowledge, as most threats are over the network.
* SecOps and NetOps questions followed by DevOps/NetOps/SysOps questions

### Red flags

* Candidate constantly mention - "we" instead of talking about what he/she did, even after several questions about his/her experience
* Candidate doesn’t tell - I don’t know to questions that he/she doesn’t know answer for, but try to answer you with as many as possible technology words in non-sensible manner.
