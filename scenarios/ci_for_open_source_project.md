## CI for Open Source Project

1. Choose an open source project from Github and fork it
2. Create a CI pipeline/workflow for the project you forked
3. The CI pipeline/workflow will include anything that is relevant to the project you forked. For example:
  * If it's a Python project, you will run PEP8
  * If the project has unit tests directory, you will run these unit tests as part of the CI
4. In a separate file, describe what is running as part of the CI and why you chose to include it. You can also describe any thoughts, dilemmas, challenge you had

### Bonus

Containerize the app of the project you forked using any containerization technology you want.
